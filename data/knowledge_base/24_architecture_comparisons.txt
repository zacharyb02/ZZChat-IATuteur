ARCHITECTURE COMPARISONS
=========================

Q1: VGG vs ResNet vs Inception - which to choose?
A:
VGG (2014):
- Simple and uniform (stacked 3x3)
- Easy to understand
- Large model (138M params)
- GOOD FOR: Transfer learning
- AVOID: Production (too heavy)

ResNet (2015):
- Skip connections = very deep possible
- Excellent performance
- Various sizes (18/50/101/152)
- Industry standard
- GOOD FOR: Almost everything!

Inception (2014):
- Parallel multi-scale modules
- Parameter efficient
- GOOD FOR: When efficiency needed
- DEFECT: Complex architecture

VERDICT: ResNet-50 for most cases

Q2: MobileNet vs EfficientNet vs ResNet for mobile?
A:
MobileNet (Google):
- Ultra-lightweight (4M params)
- Fast on mobile CPU
- Decent accuracy
- USAGE: Real-time mobile apps

EfficientNet (Google):
- Best accuracy/efficiency ratio
- Optimal compound scaling
- Family B0-B7
- USAGE: Best general choice for mobile

ResNet-18/34:
- Larger but more accurate
- USAGE: Edge servers with GPU

RULE:
- Basic smartphone: MobileNetV3-Small
- Powerful smartphone: EfficientNet-B0
- Edge with GPU: EfficientNet-B1/B2 or ResNet-18

Q3: Traditional CNNs vs Vision Transformers - who wins?
A: Current debate (2020-2024):

CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt):
ADVANTAGES:
- Better with limited data (< 100K images)
- Faster training
- Less memory
- Inductive bias for images
- Edge-friendly

DISADVANTAGES:
- Performance plateaus with lots of data
- Limited receptive field

VISION TRANSFORMERS (ViT):
ADVANTAGES:
- Better performance with massive data (> 1M images)
- Better for tasks requiring global context
- Architecture flexibility

DISADVANTAGES:
- Requires massive pretraining
- Slow and memory-hungry
- Overfits easily on small datasets

2024 VERDICT:
- Small datasets: CNNs (ResNet, ConvNeXt)
- Large datasets + resources: ViT or hybrids
- Production/edge: Optimized CNNs
