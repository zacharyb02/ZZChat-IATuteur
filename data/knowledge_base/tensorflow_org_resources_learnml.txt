# Master your path
To become an expert in machine learning, you first need a strong foundation in four learning areas : coding, math, ML theory, and how to build your own ML project from start to finish.
Begin with TensorFlow's curated curriculums to improve these four skills, or choose your own learning path by exploring our resource library below.
### The four areas of machine learning education
When beginning your educational path, it's important to first understand how to learn ML. We've broken the learning process into four areas of knowledge, with each area providing a foundational piece of the ML puzzle. To help you on your path, we've identified books, videos, and online courses that will uplevel your abilities, and prepare you to use ML for your projects. Start with our guided curriculums designed to increase your knowledge, or choose your own path by exploring our resource library.
- Coding skills: Building ML models involves much more than just knowing ML concepts—it requires coding in order to do the data management, parameter tuning, and parsing results needed to test and optimize your model.
- Math and stats: ML is a math heavy discipline, so if you plan to modify ML models or build new ones from scratch, familiarity with the underlying math concepts is crucial to the process.
- ML theory: Knowing the basics of ML theory will give you a foundation to build on, and help you troubleshoot when something goes wrong.
- Build your own projects: Getting hands on experience with ML is the best way to put your knowledge to the test, so don't be afraid to dive in early with a simple colab or tutorial to get some practice.
