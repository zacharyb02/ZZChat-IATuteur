# Learn how to integrate Responsible AI practices into your ML workflow using TensorFlow
TensorFlow is committed to helping make progress in the responsible development of AI by sharing a collection of resources and tools with the ML community.


## What is Responsible AI?
Training models off of sensitive data needs privacy preserving safeguards


## Responsible AI in your ML workflow


### Who is my ML system for?
the true impact of its predictions, recommendations, and decisions. Make
sure to get input from a diverse set of users early on in your


### Am I using a representative dataset?
Is your data sampled in a way that represents your users (e.g. will be
used for all ages, but you only have training data from senior citizens)
and the real-world setting (e.g. will be used year-round, but you only
have training data from the summer)?


### Is there real-world/human bias in my data?
Underlying biases in data can contribute to complex feedback loops that


### What methods should I use to train my model?
Use training methods that build fairness, interpretability, privacy, and
security into the model.


### How is my model performing?
of users, use cases, and contexts of use. Test and iterate in dogfood
first, followed by continued testing after launch.


### Are there complex feedback loops?
ML-based models rarely operate with 100% perfection when applied to


## Responsible AI tools for TensorFlow
The TensorFlow ecosystem has a suite of tools and resources to help tackle some of the questions above.


## Define problem
Use the following resources to design models with Responsible AI in mind.


## Construct and prepare data
Use the following tools to examine data for potential biases.
Interactively investigate your dataset to improve data quality and mitigate fairness and bias issues.
A more inclusive skin tone scale, open licensed, to make your data collection and model building needs more robust and inclusive.


## Build and train model
Use the following tools to train models using privacy-preserving, interpretable techniques, and more.
Train machine learning models to promote more equitable outcomes.
Train machine learning models with privacy.
Train machine learning models using federated learning techniques.
Implement flexible, controlled, and interpretable lattice-based models.


## Evaluate model
Debug, evaluate, and visualize model performance using the following tools.
Evaluate commonly-identified fairness metrics for binary and multi-class classifiers.
Evaluate models in a distributed manner and compute over different slices of data.
Examine, evaluate, and compare machine learning models.
Visualize and understand NLP models.
Develop interpretable and inclusive machine learning models.
Assess the privacy properties of classification models.


## Deploy and monitor
Use the following tools to track and communicate about model context and details.
Generate model cards with ease using the Model Card toolkit.


## Community resources
We asked participants to use TensorFlow 2.2 to build a model or application with Responsible AI principles in mind. Check out the gallery to see the winners and other amazing projects.
