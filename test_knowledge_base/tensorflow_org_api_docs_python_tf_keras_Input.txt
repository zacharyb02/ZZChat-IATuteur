### Used in the notebooks
- Migrate `tf.feature_column`s to Keras preprocessing layers
- Use TF1.x models in TF2 workflows
- Debug a TensorFlow 2 migrated training pipeline
- Migrate from TPU embedding_columns to TPUEmbedding layer
- Parameter server training with ParameterServerStrategy
- Classify structured data using Keras preprocessing layers
- Transfer learning with YAMNet for environmental sound classification
A Keras tensor is a symbolic tensor-like object, which we augment with
certain attributes that allow us to build a Keras model just by knowing the
inputs and outputs of the model.
For instance, if a , b and c are Keras tensors,
it becomes possible to do: model = Model(input=[a, b], output=c)


## Args
shape A shape tuple (tuple of integers or None objects),
not including the batch size.
For instance, shape=(32,) indicates that the expected input
will be batches of 32-dimensional vectors. Elements of this tuple
can be None ; None elements represent dimensions where the shape
is not known and may vary (e.g. sequence length). batch_size Optional static batch size (integer). dtype The data type expected by the input, as a string
(e.g. "float32" , "int32" ...) sparse A boolean specifying whether the expected input will be sparse
tensors. Note that, if sparse is False , sparse tensors can still
be passed into the input - they will be densified with a default
value of 0. This feature is only supported with the TensorFlow
backend. Defaults to False . name Optional name string for the layer.
Should be unique in a model (do not reuse the same name twice).
It will be autogenerated if it isn't provided. tensor Optional existing tensor to wrap into the Input layer.
If set, the layer will use this tensor rather
than creating a new placeholder tensor.


## Returns


# This is a logistic regression in Keras
x = Input(shape=(32,))
y = Dense(16, activation='softmax')(x)
model = Model(x, y)
