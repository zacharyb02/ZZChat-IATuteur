tf.numpy_function(
    func=None, inp=None, Tout=None, stateful=True, name=None
)




### Used in the notebooks
Given a python function func wrap this function as an operation in a tf.function . func must take numpy arrays as its arguments and
return numpy arrays as its outputs.
There are two ways to use tf.numpy_function .


### As a decorator
When using tf.numpy_function as a decorator:


@tf.numpy_function(Tout=tf.float32)
def my_numpy_func(x):
  # x will be a numpy array with the contents of the input to the
  # tf.function
  print(f'executing eagerly, {x=}')
  return np.sinh(x)




my_numpy_func(1.0).numpy()
executing eagerly, x=1.0




@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(None, tf.float32)])
def tf_function(input):
  y = tf.numpy_function(my_numpy_func, [input], tf.float32)
  return y
tf_function(tf.constant(1.)).numpy()
executing eagerly, x=array(1.)




### Inplace


def my_func(x):
  # x will be a numpy array with the contents of the input to the
  # tf.function
  print(f'executing eagerly, {x=}')
  return np.sinh(x)


To run tf.numpy_function in-place, pass the function, its inputs, and the
output type in a single call to tf.numpy_function :


tf.numpy_function(my_func, [tf.constant(1.0)], tf.float32)
executing eagerly, x=array(1.)




### More info
Comparison to tf.py_function : tf.py_function and tf.numpy_function are very similar, except that tf.numpy_function takes numpy arrays, and not tf.Tensor s. If you want the
function to contain tf.Tensors , and have any TensorFlow operations executed
- Calling tf.numpy_function will acquire the Python Global Interpreter Lock
(GIL) that allows only one thread to run at any point in time. This will
program. Therefore, you are discouraged to use tf.numpy_function outside
- The body of the function (i.e. func ) will not be serialized in a tf.SavedModel . Therefore, you should not use this function if you need to
serialize your model and restore it in a different environment.
that calls tf.numpy_function() . If you are using distributed
TensorFlow, you must run a tf.distribute.Server in the same process as the
program that calls tf.numpy_function you must pin the created
operation to a device in that server (e.g. using with tf.device(): ).
- Currently tf.numpy_function is not compatible with XLA. Calling tf.numpy_function inside tf.function(jit_compile=True) will raise an
- Since the function takes numpy arrays, you cannot take gradients
through a numpy_function. If you require something that is differentiable,


## Args
func A Python function, which accepts numpy.ndarray objects as arguments
and returns a list of numpy.ndarray objects (or a single numpy.ndarray ). This function must accept as many arguments as there are
tensors in inp , and these argument types will match the corresponding tf.Tensor objects in inp . The returns numpy.ndarray s must match the
number and types defined Tout . Important Note: Input and output numpy.ndarray s of func are not guaranteed to be copies. In some cases
their underlying memory will be shared with the corresponding TensorFlow
tensors. In-place modification or storing func input or return values in
python datastructures without explicit (np.)copy can have
non-deterministic consequences. inp A list of tf.Tensor objects. Tout A list or tuple of tensorflow data types or a single tensorflow data
type if there is only one, indicating what func returns. stateful (Boolean.) Setting this argument to False tells the runtime to
function is stateless when given the same input it will return the same
output and have no side effects; its only purpose is to have a return
the input arguments as this is a stateful operation. name (Optional) A name for the operation.


## Returns
- If func is None this returns a decorator that will ensure the
and returns the result: A single or list of tf.Tensor which func computes.
