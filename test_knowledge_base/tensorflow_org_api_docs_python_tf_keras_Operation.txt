tf.keras.Operation(
    dtype=None, name=None
)




## Attributes
input Retrieves the input tensor(s) of a symbolic operation.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called. output Retrieves the output tensor(s) of a layer.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called.


## Methods


### call


call(
    *args, **kwargs
)




### compute_output_spec


compute_output_spec(
    *args, **kwargs
)




### from_config


from_config(
    config
)


Creates a layer from its config.
capable of instantiating the same layer from the config
dictionary. It does not handle layer connectivity
(handled by Network), nor weights (handled by set_weights ).
output of get_config.


### get_config
An object config is a Python dictionary (serializable)
