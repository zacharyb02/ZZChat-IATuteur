Build the tf.keras model using the Keras model subclassing API :


class MyModel(Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.conv1 = Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')
    self.flatten = Flatten()
    self.d1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')
    self.d2 = Dense(10)
  def call(self, x):
    x = self.conv1(x)
    x = self.flatten(x)
    x = self.d1(x)
    return self.d2(x)
# Create an instance of the model
model = MyModel()


Choose an optimizer and loss function for training:


loss_object = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()


Select metrics to measure the loss and the accuracy of the model. These metrics accumulate the values over epochs and then print the overall result.


train_loss = tf.keras.metrics.Mean(name='train_loss')
train_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='train_accuracy')
test_loss = tf.keras.metrics.Mean(name='test_loss')
test_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='test_accuracy')


Use tf.GradientTape to train the model:


def train_step(images, labels):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # training=True is only needed if there are layers with different
    # behavior during training versus inference (e.g. Dropout).
    predictions = model(images, training=True)
    loss = loss_object(labels, predictions)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  train_loss(loss)
  train_accuracy(labels, predictions)




def test_step(images, labels):
  # training=False is only needed if there are layers with different
  # behavior during training versus inference (e.g. Dropout).
  predictions = model(images, training=False)
  t_loss = loss_object(labels, predictions)
  test_loss(t_loss)
  test_accuracy(labels, predictions)




EPOCHS = 5
for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
  # Reset the metrics at the start of the next epoch
  train_loss.reset_state()
  train_accuracy.reset_state()
  test_loss.reset_state()
  test_accuracy.reset_state()
    train_step(images, labels)
  for test_images, test_labels in test_ds:
    test_step(test_images, test_labels)
  print(
    f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, '
    f'Loss: {train_loss.result():0.2f}, '
    f'Accuracy: {train_accuracy.result() * 100:0.2f}, '
    f'Test Loss: {test_loss.result():0.2f}, '
    f'Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy.result() * 100:0.2f}'
  )
