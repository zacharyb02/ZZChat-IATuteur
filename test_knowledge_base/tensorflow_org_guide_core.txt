The TensorFlow Core APIs provide a set of comprehensive, composable, and
extensible low-level APIs for high-performance (distributed and accelerated)
computation, primarily aimed at building machine learning (ML) models as well as
authoring ML workflow tools and frameworks within the TensorFlow platform. These
APIs provide a foundation for creating highly configurable models with
like Keras. These high-level APIs are best suited for general machine learning
you are looking for an overview of TensorFlow using Keras, see the Quickstarts
and Keras sections in the tutorials .


## Who should use the Core APIs
The TensorFlow Core low-level APIs are designed with the following ML developers
- Researchers building complex models with high levels of configurability
- Developers interested in using TensorFlow as a high-performance scientific
- Framework authors building tools on top of the TensorFlow platform
such as custom layers, losses, models, and optimizers Learning more about the inner workings of their models
such as custom layers, losses, models, and optimizers
- Learning more about the inner workings of their models


## Core API applications
The TensorFlow Core APIs provide access to low level functionality within the
TensorFlow ecosystem. This API provides more flexibility and control for
building ML models, applications, and tools, compared to high-level APIs, such
as Keras.


### Build models and workflows
machine learning models and workflows. Here are some of the ways that the
TensorFlow Core APIs can improve your machine learning models and workflow
- Building non-traditional models or layers that do not fully fit the
- Building custom layers, losses, models, and optimizers within Keras
- Implementing new optimization techniques to expedite convergence during
training
- Designing highly-configurable training loops with support for features like
batching, cross-validation, and distribution strategies


### Build frameworks and tools
The TensorFlow Core APIs can also serve as the building blocks for new
- Keras : deep learning for humans
- TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit :
a suite of tools to optimize ML models for deployment and execution
- TensorFlow Graphics : a library for


### Build for scientific computing
The TensorFlow Core APIs can also be applied outside the realm of machine
learning. Here are a few general-purpose use cases of TensorFlow for scientific


## Core API components
Here are some of the fundamental components that comprise TensorFlow Core’s low-
- Data structures : tf.Tensor , tf.Variable , tf.TensorArray
- Primitive APIs: tf.shape , slicing , tf.concat , tf.bitwise
- Functional components: tf.function , tf.GradientTape
