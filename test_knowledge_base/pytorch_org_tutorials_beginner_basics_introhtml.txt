# Learn the Basics#
Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, optimizing model
parameters, and saving the trained models. This tutorial introduces you to a complete ML workflow
implemented in PyTorch, with links to learn more about each of these concepts.
We’ll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs


## Running the Tutorial Code#
- Locally : This option requires you to set up PyTorch and TorchVision first on your local machine ( installation instructions ). Download the notebook or copy the code into your favorite IDE.


## How to Use this Guide#
to quickly familiarize yourself with PyTorch’s API.
If you’re new to deep learning frameworks, head right into the first section of our step-by-step guide: 1. Tensors .
