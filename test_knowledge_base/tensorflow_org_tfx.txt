# TFX is an end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines
When you're ready to move your models from research to production, use TFX to create and manage a production pipeline.


### How it works


## How companies are using TFX


## Solutions to common problems
This guide trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts, saves the trained model, and then serves it with TensorFlow Serving. The focus is on TensorFlow Serving, rather than the modeling and training in TensorFlow.
Learn how TFX can create and evaluate machine learning models that will be deployed on-device. TFX now provides native support for TFLite, which makes it possible to perform highly efficient inference on mobile devices.
