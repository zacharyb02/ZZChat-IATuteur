# Master your path
Begin with TensorFlow's curated curriculums to improve these four skills, or choose your own learning path by exploring our resource library below.


### The four areas of machine learning education
- Coding skills: Building ML models involves much more than just knowing ML concepts—it requires coding in order to do the data management, parameter tuning, and parsing results needed to test and optimize your model.
- Math and stats: ML is a math heavy discipline, so if you plan to modify ML models or build new ones from scratch, familiarity with the underlying math concepts is crucial to the process.
- Build your own projects: Getting hands on experience with ML is the best way to put your knowledge to the test, so don't be afraid to dive in early with a simple colab or tutorial to get some practice.


## TensorFlow curriculums
