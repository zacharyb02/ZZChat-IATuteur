# TensorFlow.js is a library for machine learning in JavaScript
Develop ML models in JavaScript, and use ML directly in the browser or in Node.js.
Tutorials show you how to use TensorFlow.js with complete, end-to-end examples.
Pre-trained, out-of-the-box models for common use cases.
Live demos and examples run in your browser using TensorFlow.js.


## How it works
Use off-the-shelf JavaScript models or convert Python TensorFlow models to run in the browser or under Node.js.
Retrain pre-existing ML models using your own data.
Build and train models directly in JavaScript using flexible and intuitive APIs.
