A sparse representation of a set of tensor slices at given indices.


tf.IndexedSlices(
    values, indices, dense_shape=None
)




### Used in the notebooks
- Client-efficient large-model federated learning via `federated_select` and sparse aggregation
This class is a simple wrapper for a pair of Tensor objects:
- values : A Tensor of any dtype with shape [D0, D1, ..., Dn] .
- indices : A 1-D integer Tensor with shape [D0] .
tensor dense of shape [LARGE0, D1, .. , DN] where LARGE0 >> D0 .
the slices that have been extracted from the larger tensor.
The dense tensor dense represented by an IndexedSlices slices has


dense[slices.indices[i], :, :, :, ...] = slices.values[i, :, :, :, ...]


The IndexedSlices class is used principally in the definition of
gradients for operations that have sparse gradients
(e.g. tf.gather ).


v = tf.Variable([[0.,1, 2], [2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6], [6, 7, 8]])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  r = tf.gather(v, [1,3])
index_slices = tape.gradient(r,v)
index_slices.indices.numpy()
array([1, 3], dtype=int32)
index_slices.values.numpy()
array([[1., 1., 1.],
       [1., 1., 1.]], dtype=float32)


Contrast this representation with tf.sparse.SparseTensor ,
