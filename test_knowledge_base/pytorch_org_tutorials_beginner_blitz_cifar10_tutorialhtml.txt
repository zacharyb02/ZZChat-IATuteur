# Training a Classifier#
This is it. You have seen how to define neural networks, compute loss and make
updates to the weights of the network.


## What about data?#
you can use standard python packages that load data into a numpy array.
Then you can convert this array into a torch.*Tensor .
Specifically for vision, we have created a package called torchvision , that has data loaders for common datasets such as
ImageNet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz., torchvision.datasets and torch.utils.data.DataLoader .
This provides a huge convenience and avoids writing boilerplate code.


## Training an image classifier#
- Load and normalize the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision
- Define a Convolutional Neural Network
- Train the network on the training data
- Test the network on the test data


### 1. Load and normalize CIFAR10#
Using torchvision , it’s extremely easy to load CIFAR10.


import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms


The output of torchvision datasets are PILImage images of range [0, 1].
We transform them to Tensors of normalized range [-1, 1].
the num_worker of torch.utils.data.DataLoader() to 0.


transform = transforms.Compose(
    [transforms.ToTensor(),
     transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])
batch_size = 4
trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                        download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=batch_size,
                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)
testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False,
                                       download=True, transform=transform)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=batch_size,
                                         shuffle=False, num_workers=2)
classes = ('plane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat',
           'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck')

Let us show some of the training images, for fun.


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
# functions to show an image
def imshow(img):
    img = img / 2 + 0.5     # unnormalize
    npimg = img.numpy()
    plt.imshow(np.transpose(npimg, (1, 2, 0)))
    plt.show()
# get some random training images
dataiter = iter(trainloader)
images, labels = next(dataiter)
# show images
imshow(torchvision.utils.make_grid(images))
# print labels
print(' '.join(f'{classes[labels[j]]:5s}' for j in range(batch_size)))








### 2. Define a Convolutional Neural Network#
take 3-channel images (instead of 1-channel images as it was defined).


import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1) # flatten all dimensions except batch
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
net = Net()




### 3. Define a Loss function and optimizer#
Let’s use a Classification Cross-Entropy loss and SGD with momentum.


import torch.optim as optim
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)




### 4. Train the network#
We simply have to loop over our data iterator, and feed the inputs to the


for epoch in range(2):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        # get the inputs; data is a list of [inputs, labels]
        inputs, labels = data
        # zero the parameter gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        # forward + backward + optimize
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        # print statistics
        running_loss += loss.item()
        if i % 2000 == 1999:    # print every 2000 mini-batches
            print(f'[{epoch + 1}, {i + 1:5d}] loss: {running_loss / 2000:.3f}')
            running_loss = 0.0
print('Finished Training')




[1,  2000] loss: 2.145
[1,  4000] loss: 1.808
[1,  6000] loss: 1.638
[1,  8000] loss: 1.561
[1, 10000] loss: 1.508
[1, 12000] loss: 1.477
[2,  2000] loss: 1.401
[2,  4000] loss: 1.382
[2,  6000] loss: 1.327
[2,  8000] loss: 1.342
[2, 10000] loss: 1.309
[2, 12000] loss: 1.268
Finished Training


Let’s quickly save our trained model:


PATH = './cifar_net.pth'
torch.save(net.state_dict(), PATH)


See here for more details on saving PyTorch models.


### 5. Test the network on the test data#
We have trained the network for 2 passes over the training dataset.
We will check this by predicting the class label that the neural network
outputs, and checking it against the ground-truth. If the prediction is
correct, we add the sample to the list of correct predictions.
Okay, first step. Let us display an image from the test set to get familiar.


dataiter = iter(testloader)
images, labels = next(dataiter)
# print images
imshow(torchvision.utils.make_grid(images))
print('GroundTruth: ', ' '.join(f'{classes[labels[j]]:5s}' for j in range(4)))






Next, let’s load back in our saved model (note: saving and re-loading the model
wasn’t necessary here, we only did it to illustrate how to do so):


net = Net()
net.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH, weights_only=True))








outputs = net(images)


The outputs are energies for the 10 classes.


_, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
print('Predicted: ', ' '.join(f'{classes[predicted[j]]:5s}'
                              for j in range(4)))








correct = 0
total = 0
# since we're not training, we don't need to calculate the gradients for our outputs
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        images, labels = data
        # calculate outputs by running images through the network
        outputs = net(images)
        # the class with the highest energy is what we choose as prediction
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
print(f'Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: {100 * correct // total} %')




Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: 53 %


That looks way better than chance, which is 10% accuracy (randomly picking
a class out of 10 classes).


# prepare to count predictions for each class
correct_pred = {classname: 0 for classname in classes}
total_pred = {classname: 0 for classname in classes}
# again no gradients needed
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        images, labels = data
        outputs = net(images)
        _, predictions = torch.max(outputs, 1)
        # collect the correct predictions for each class
        for label, prediction in zip(labels, predictions):
            if label == prediction:
                correct_pred[classes[label]] += 1
            total_pred[classes[label]] += 1
# print accuracy for each class
for classname, correct_count in correct_pred.items():
    accuracy = 100 * float(correct_count) / total_pred[classname]
    print(f'Accuracy for class: {classname:5s} is {accuracy:.1f} %')




Accuracy for class: plane is 69.0 %
Accuracy for class: car   is 72.1 %
Accuracy for class: bird  is 29.0 %
Accuracy for class: cat   is 53.0 %
Accuracy for class: deer  is 34.5 %
Accuracy for class: dog   is 25.5 %
Accuracy for class: frog  is 59.5 %
Accuracy for class: horse is 63.1 %
Accuracy for class: ship  is 53.4 %
Accuracy for class: truck is 76.6 %




## Training on GPU#
Just like how you transfer a Tensor onto the GPU, you transfer the neural


device = torch.device('cuda:0' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
# Assuming that we are on a CUDA machine, this should print a CUDA device:
print(device)


Then these methods will recursively go over all modules and convert their
parameters and buffers to CUDA tensors:
Remember that you will have to send the inputs and targets at every step


inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)


Exercise: Try increasing the width of your network (argument 2 of
the first nn.Conv2d , and argument 1 of the second nn.Conv2d –
they need to be the same number), see what kind of speedup you get.
