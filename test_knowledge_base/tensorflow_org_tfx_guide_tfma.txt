## Introduction
As you tweak your model during development, you need to check whether your
changes are improving your model. Just checking accuracy may not be enough. For
are positive, you may be able to improve accuracy by simply always predicting


## Overview
The goal of TensorFlow Model Analysis is to provide a mechanism for model
evaluation in TFX. TensorFlow Model Analysis allows you to perform model
- Metrics computed on entire training and holdout
- Model quality performance on different feature slices
- Model validation for ensuring that
model's maintain consistent performance
