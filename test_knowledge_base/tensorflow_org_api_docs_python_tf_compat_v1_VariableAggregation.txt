tf.distribute.Strategy distributes a model by making multiple copies
(called "replicas") acting on different elements of the input batch in a
data parallel model. When performing some variable-update operation,
for example var.assign_add(x) , in a model, we need to resolve how to combine
- MEAN : Take the arithmetic mean ("average") of the updates across replicas.


strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(["GPU:0", "GPU:1"])
with strategy.scope():
  v = tf.Variable(5.0, aggregation=tf.VariableAggregation.MEAN)
def update_fn():
  return v.assign_add(1.0)
strategy.run(update_fn)
PerReplica:{
  0: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>,
  1: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>
}
