REAL-WORLD CNN APPLICATIONS
============================

Q1: In which domains are CNNs used today?
A:
COMPUTER VISION:
- Face recognition (iPhone Face ID, security)
- Autonomous cars (Tesla, Waymo)
- Surveillance and security
- Retail (Amazon Go)

MEDICINE:
- Cancer detection (X-rays, mammograms)
- Diabetic retinopathy analysis
- Organ and tumor segmentation

AGRICULTURE:
- Plant disease detection
- Livestock counting
- Crop optimization

INDUSTRY:
- Automated quality control
- Manufacturing defect detection
- Predictive maintenance

CREATIVE:
- Photo filters (Snapchat, Instagram)
- Image generation (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- Old photo restoration

Q2: How are CNNs used in autonomous vehicles?
A: Autonomous vehicles like Tesla use multiple CNNs simultaneously:

OBJECT DETECTION:
- Pedestrians, cyclists, other vehicles
- Traffic signs
- Traffic lights
- Road obstacles

SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION:
- Road vs sidewalk
- Lane lines
- Drivable zones

ARCHITECTURE:
- Multi-camera (8 cameras on Tesla)
- Data fusion (camera + LIDAR + RADAR)
- Real-time inference (< 100ms)

Q3: How are CNNs used in medicine?
A: Major impact on medical diagnosis:

RADIOLOGY:
- Breast tumor detection (mammography)
- Lung X-ray analysis (COVID-19, pneumonia)
- Brain MRI (tumors, stroke)
- Performance equal or superior to expert radiologists

OPHTHALMOLOGY:
- Diabetic retinopathy (Google Health)
- Glaucoma, macular degeneration
- FDA approved for autonomous diagnosis

ADVANTAGES:
- Available 24/7
- Rapid diagnosis
- Access in underserved areas
- Systematic second opinion

LIMITS:
- Not a replacement for doctor
- Needs clinical validation
- Unclear legal responsibility

Q4: What is the impact of CNNs on social media?
A: CNNs are omnipresent on platforms:

FILTERS AND EFFECTS:
- Snapchat/Instagram: face detection + real-time manipulation
- TikTok: AR effects

CONTENT MODERATION:
- Inappropriate content detection (nudity, violence)
- Automatic removal
- Child protection

ORGANIZATION:
- Object/scene recognition for photo search
- Automatic tag suggestions
- Smart albums (Google Photos)

ADVERTISING:
- Visual content analysis
- Targeting based on posted images

PROBLEMS:
- Undetectable deepfakes
- Moderation bias
- Excessive surveillance
