- Getting Started with TensorFlow Transform
- TensorFlow Transform API Reference
The tft module documentation is the only module that is relevant to TFX users.
The tft_beam module is relevant only when using Transform as a standalone library. Typically, a TFX user constructs a preprocessing_fn , and the rest of the
Transform library calls are made by the Transform component.
You can also use the Apache Beam MLTransform class to preprocess data
for training and inference. The MLTransform class wraps multiple TFX data
processing transforms in one class. For more information, see Preprocess data with MLTransform in the Apache Beam documentation.
