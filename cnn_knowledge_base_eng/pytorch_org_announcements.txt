### Feast Joins the PyTorch Ecosystem: Bridging Feature Stores and Deep Learning
PyTorch revolutionized how we build and serve AI models, but getting them to production remains challenging. Data inconsistencies between training and serving environments are one of the primary challenges AI models face in getting into production, what the AI industry has coined  "training-serving skew." Even the most impactful models fail…
