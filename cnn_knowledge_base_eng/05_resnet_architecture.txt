RESNET ARCHITECTURE (RESIDUAL NETWORKS)
========================================

Q1: What is ResNet and why is it revolutionary?
A: ResNet (2015) introduced skip connections (residual connections) enabling training of very deep networks (152+ layers) without performance degradation.

Problem solved: Performance degradation with depth (vanishing gradients)
Solution: Skip connections allow gradients to flow directly

Q2: How do residual connections work?
A: Instead of learning F(x), the network learns the residual: F(x) = H(x) - x
Output = F(x) + x (addition of skip connection)

Q3: How to implement a basic residual block?
A:
import torch.nn as nn

class BasicResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, stride=1):
        super().__init__()
        
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 3, stride, 1, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, 3, 1, 1, bias=False)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)
        
        # Skip connection with projection if necessary
        self.shortcut = nn.Sequential()
        if stride != 1 or in_channels != out_channels:
            self.shortcut = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 1, stride, bias=False),
                nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
            )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        identity = x
        
        out = self.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        out = self.bn2(self.conv2(out))
        
        out += self.shortcut(identity)
        out = self.relu(out)
        
        return out

Q4: How to use pretrained ResNet with transfer learning?
A:
import torchvision.models as models

# Load pretrained ResNet-18
resnet18 = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Option 1: Feature extractor (freeze all weights)
for param in resnet18.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Replace last layer for your number of classes
num_features = resnet18.fc.in_features
resnet18.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, 10)

# Option 2: Fine-tuning (unfreeze last layers)
for name, param in resnet18.named_parameters():
    if "layer4" not in name and "fc" not in name:
        param.requires_grad = False

resnet18.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, 10)
