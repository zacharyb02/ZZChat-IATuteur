The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1 / (1 - rate) such that the sum over
all inputs is unchanged.
Note that the Dropout layer only applies when training is set to True in call() , such that no values are dropped during inference.
When using model.fit , training will be appropriately set to True automatically. In other contexts, you can set the argument explicitly
to True when calling the layer.
(This is in contrast to setting trainable=False for a Dropout layer. trainable does not affect the layer's behavior, as Dropout does
not have any variables/weights that can be frozen during training.)
## Args
rate Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop. noise_shape 1D integer tensor representing the shape of the
binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input.
For instance, if your inputs have shape (batch_size, timesteps, features) and
you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps,
you can use noise_shape=(batch_size, 1, features) . seed A Python integer to use as random seed.
## Call arguments
inputs Input tensor (of any rank). training Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in
training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing nothing).
## Attributes
input Retrieves the input tensor(s) of a symbolic operation.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called. output Retrieves the output tensor(s) of a layer.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called.
## Methods
### from_config
```python
@classmethod
from_config(
config
Creates a layer from its config.
This method is the reverse of get_config ,
capable of instantiating the same layer from the config
dictionary. It does not handle layer connectivity
(handled by Network), nor weights (handled by set_weights ).
config A Python dictionary, typically the
output of get_config.
### symbolic_call
```python
symbolic_call(
*args, **kwargs
