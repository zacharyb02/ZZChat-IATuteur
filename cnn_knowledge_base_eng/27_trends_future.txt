TRENDS AND FUTURE
==================

Q1: What are current CNN research trends (2024-2025)?
A: Rapid evolution in several directions:

EFFICIENCY:
- Automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
- 4-bit, 2-bit quantization
- Dynamic pruning during training
- Edge AI (ultra-light models)

HYBRIDIZATION:
- CNN + Transformers (best of both worlds)
- ConvNeXt: CNN with Transformer designs
- Hierarchical Vision Transformers (Swin)

SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING:
- Less need for labels
- Contrastive learning (SimCLR, MoCo)
- Masked image modeling (MAE)

FOUNDATION MODELS:
- Giant pretrained models (like CLIP)
- Zero-shot learning
- Adaptable to multiple tasks

Q2: What is self-supervised learning and why important?
A: Learning without human labels:

PRINCIPLE:
- Create artificial tasks (rotation, puzzle)
- Model learns useful representations
- Fine-tune with few labels

POPULAR METHODS:
- SimCLR (Google): contrastive learning
- MoCo (Facebook): momentum contrast
- MAE (Facebook): masked autoencoding
- DINO (Facebook): self-distillation

ADVANTAGES:
- Exploits unlabeled data (nearly infinite)
- Reduces annotation cost (crucial!)
- More robust representations

FUTURE:
- Replace ImageNet pretraining
- Self-supervised foundation models

Q3: What is Neural Architecture Search (NAS)?
A: AI to design AI:

PRINCIPLE:
- Algorithm automatically searches optimal architecture
- Enormous search space (billions of possibilities)
- Evaluates each architecture by training

METHODS:
- Reinforcement learning (Google NAS)
- Evolutionary algorithms
- Gradient-based (DARTS)

RESULTS:
- EfficientNet: found by NAS
- Sometimes outperforms human architectures

LIMITATIONS:
- Extremely expensive (1000s GPU-hours)
- Overfitting to benchmark
- Difficult to reproduce

FUTURE:
- More accessible NAS
- Hardware-aware NAS
- Once-for-all networks

Q4: Predictions for 2025-2030?
A: Likely evolutions:

SHORT TERM (2025-2026):
- Hybrid CNN-Transformer dominant
- Self-supervised pretraining standard
