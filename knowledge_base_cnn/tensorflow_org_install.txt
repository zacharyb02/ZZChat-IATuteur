### Install TensorFlow 2
TensorFlow is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:
- Windows 7 or later (with C++ redistributable )
- macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (no GPU support)
- WSL2 via Windows 10 19044 or higher including GPUs (Experimental)


```python
# Requires the latest pip
pip install --upgrade pip
# Current stable release for CPU
pip install tensorflow
# Current stable release for GPU (Linux / WSL2)
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
# Or try the preview build (unstable)
pip install tf-nightly
```




### Download a package
Install TensorFlow with Python's pip package manager.
Official packages available for Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.


### Run a TensorFlow container
The TensorFlow
  Docker images are already configured to run TensorFlow. A Docker container runs in a
  virtual environment and is the easiest way to set up GPU support.


```python
docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:latest  # Download latest stable image docker run -it -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-jupyter  # Start Jupyter server
```




### Google Colab: An easy way to learn and use TensorFlow
No install necessary—run the TensorFlow tutorials directly in
  the browser with Colaboratory , a Google research project created to help disseminate
  machine learning education and research. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires
  no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud. Read the blog post .
