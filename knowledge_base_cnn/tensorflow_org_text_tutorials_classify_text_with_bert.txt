# Classify text with BERTStay organized with collectionsSave and categorize content based on your preferences.
This tutorial contains complete code to fine-tune BERT to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of plain-text IMDB movie reviews.
In addition to training a model, you will learn how to preprocess text into an appropriate format.
- Load a BERT model from TensorFlow Hub
- Build your own model by combining BERT with a classifier
- Train your own model, fine-tuning BERT as part of that
- Save your model and use it to classify sentences
If you're new to working with the IMDB dataset, please see Basic text classification for more details.


## About BERT
BERT and other Transformer encoder architectures have been wildly successful on a variety of tasks in NLP (natural language processing). They compute vector-space representations of natural language that are suitable for use in deep learning models. The BERT family of models uses the Transformer encoder architecture to process each token of input text in the full context of all tokens before and after, hence the name: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.
BERT models are usually pre-trained on a large corpus of text, then fine-tuned for specific tasks.


## Setup


```python
# A dependency of the preprocessing for BERT inputs
pip install -U "tensorflow-text==2.13.*"
```


You will use the AdamW optimizer from tensorflow/models .


```python
import os
import shutil
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import tensorflow_text as text
from official.nlp import optimization  # to create AdamW optimizer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
```




## Sentiment analysis
This notebook trains a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative , based on the text of the review.
You'll use the Large Movie Review Dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database .


### Download the IMDB dataset
Let's download and extract the dataset, then explore the directory structure.


```python
url = 'https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz'
dataset = tf.keras.utils.get_file('aclImdb_v1.tar.gz', url,
                                  untar=True, cache_dir='.',
                                  cache_subdir='')
dataset_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(dataset), 'aclImdb')
train_dir = os.path.join(dataset_dir, 'train')
# remove unused folders to make it easier to load the data
remove_dir = os.path.join(train_dir, 'unsup')
shutil.rmtree(remove_dir)
```




```python

84125825/84125825 [==============================] - 6s 0us/step
```


Next, you will use the text_dataset_from_directory utility to create a labeled tf.data.Dataset .
The IMDB dataset has already been divided into train and test, but it lacks a validation set. Let's create a validation set using an 80:20 split of the training data by using the validation_split argument below.


```python
AUTOTUNE = tf.data.AUTOTUNE
batch_size = 32
seed = 42
raw_train_ds = tf.keras.utils.text_dataset_from_directory(
    'aclImdb/train',
    batch_size=batch_size,
    validation_split=0.2,
    subset='training',
    seed=seed)
class_names = raw_train_ds.class_names
train_ds = raw_train_ds.cache().prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)
val_ds = tf.keras.utils.text_dataset_from_directory(
    'aclImdb/train',
    batch_size=batch_size,
    validation_split=0.2,
    subset='validation',
    seed=seed)
val_ds = val_ds.cache().prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)
test_ds = tf.keras.utils.text_dataset_from_directory(
    'aclImdb/test',
    batch_size=batch_size)
test_ds = test_ds.cache().prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)
```

Let's take a look at a few reviews.


```python
for text_batch, label_batch in train_ds.take(1):
  for i in range(3):
    print(f'Review: {text_batch.numpy()[i]}')
    label = label_batch.numpy()[i]
    print(f'Label : {label} ({class_names[label]})')
```

Review: b'"Pandemonium" is a horror movie spoof that comes off more stupid than funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedies. Especially comedy spoofs. "Airplane", "The Naked Gun" trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety", and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not up there with those films. Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\'s all this film has going for it. Geez, "Scream" had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film. How bizarre is that?<br /><br />*1/2 (out of four)'

Review: b"David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated."
Label : 0 (neg)
Review: b'Great documentary about the lives of NY firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time.. That reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item.. What shocked me was not only the attacks, but the"High Fat Diet" and physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think a lot of Doctors would agree with me that,in the physical shape they were in, some of these firefighters would NOT of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear. Having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job. The French have a history of making great documentary\'s and that is what this is, a Great Documentary.....'

2024-07-19 11:36:50.738060: W tensorflow/core/kernels/data/cache_dataset_ops.cc:854] The calling iterator did not fully read the dataset being cached. In order to avoid unexpected truncation of the dataset, the partially cached contents of the dataset  will be discarded. This can happen if you have an input pipeline similar to `dataset.cache().take(k).repeat()`. You should use `dataset.take(k).cache().repeat()` instead.

## Loading models from TensorFlow Hub
Here you can choose which BERT model you will load from TensorFlow Hub and fine-tune. There are multiple BERT models available.
- BERT-Base , Uncased and seven more models with trained weights released by the original BERT authors.
- Small BERTs have the same general architecture but fewer and/or smaller Transformer blocks, which lets you explore tradeoffs between speed, size and quality.
- ALBERT : four different sizes of "A Lite BERT" that reduces model size (but not computation time) by sharing parameters between layers.
- BERT Experts : eight models that all have the BERT-base architecture but offer a choice between different pre-training domains, to align more closely with the target task.
- Electra has the same architecture as BERT (in three different sizes), but gets pre-trained as a discriminator in a set-up that resembles a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
- BERT with Talking-Heads Attention and Gated GELU [ base , large ] has two improvements to the core of the Transformer architecture.
The model documentation on TensorFlow Hub has more details and references to the
research literature. Follow the links above, or click on the tfhub.dev URL
printed after the next cell execution.
The suggestion is to start with a Small BERT (with fewer parameters) since they are faster to fine-tune. If you like a small model but with higher accuracy, ALBERT might be your next option. If you want even better accuracy, choose
one of the classic BERT sizes or their recent refinements like Electra, Talking Heads, or a BERT Expert.
Aside from the models available below, there are multiple versions of the models that are larger and can yield even better accuracy, but they are too big to be fine-tuned on a single GPU. You will be able to do that on the Solve GLUE tasks using BERT on a TPU colab .
You'll see in the code below that switching the tfhub.dev URL is enough to try any of these models, because all the differences between them are encapsulated in the SavedModels from TF Hub.
