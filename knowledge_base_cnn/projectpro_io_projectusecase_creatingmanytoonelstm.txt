## Project Description
Overview
In this project, we will explore the fascinating world of sentiment analysis and text generation using many-to-one Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.
Sentiment Detection:
We will dive into sentiment analysis by training an LSTM model to analyze airline sentiments. The dataset consists of sentiment labels (0 or 1) and corresponding text reviews. We will preprocess the data, converting it into a numerical representation using the bag-of-words technique. Through the many-to-one LSTM architecture, we will predict sentiment labels based on the textual input.
Text Generation:
Next, we will venture into the realm of text generation. Using the beloved classic "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" as our training text, we will prepare and structure the data to facilitate the training of many-to-one LSTMs. These LSTMs will learn the patterns and sequences in the text, enabling us to generate new text based on a given prompt. We will focus specifically on next-word prediction, allowing us to generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences.
During our exploration, we will address the challenges of text generation, including the dynamic nature of language and the presence of multiple words with similar meanings. To overcome these challenges, we will utilize techniques such as entropy scaling and softmax temperature. By adjusting the temperature parameter, we can control the randomness and diversity of the generated text.
By the end of this project, you will have gained hands-on experience in sentiment analysis and text generation using many-to-one LSTMs. You will understand the intricacies of sentiment detection, as well as the nuances of generating text with contextual relevance. These skills will empower you to apply LSTM-based techniques in various domains, opening up possibilities for analyzing sentiments and generating creative text.
Aim
This project aims to develop a sentiment detection model using many-to-one LSTMs to accurately predict sentiment labels (0 or 1) based on airline text reviews. Additionally, we aim to utilize many-to-one LSTMs to generate contextually relevant text by training on "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and predicting the next word in a sequence.
Data Description
- airline_sentiment.csv:
This dataset contains information related to airline sentiments. It is provided in a CSV format with two columns: "airline_sentiment" and "text". The "airline_sentiment" column includes sentiment labels (0 or 1) indicating the sentiment associated with each text review. The "text" column contains the actual text reviews provided by airline customers.
The "alice.txt" dataset is the Project Gutenberg eBook of "Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. It is a classic literary work in the form of a text file. This dataset serves as the training text for text generation using many-to-one LSTMs. It provides a rich and diverse collection of sentences and phrases to learn from, allowing the model to generate contextually relevant text based on the training data.
