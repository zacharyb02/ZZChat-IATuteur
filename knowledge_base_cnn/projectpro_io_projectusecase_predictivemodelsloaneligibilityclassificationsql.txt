## Project Description
Business Objective:
The primary source of profit for the banking sector is from loan interests. Hence, Banks invest a lot of time and money in analyzing a loan applicant’s profile and their repaying capacity before granting them a loan. Going through the profile of every applicant manually and assessing each applicant’s repaying capacity is a highly tedious job, and this is why automating this process is necessary.
To build such a predictive model, we will need a data set, also known as training data.  In today’s world, where data can be stored in various database structures, MySQL, a fully-featured relational database, is a widely used management system.
In this project, we will build an automated machine learning model to predict the repaying capacity of applicants by using MySQL as our database. The Google Cloud Platform(GCP) is used as the cloud platform to create a jupyter lab for model training.
Aim :
To build a predictive model with MySQL as a data store to predict if an applicant is capable of repaying the loan or not.
Tech Stack:
- Language: Python
- Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- Data Management: MySQL, DBMS, SQL queries
- Cloud: GCP
Approach:
Step 1: Create a virtual machine instance in the google cloud platform
Step 2: Install Anaconda, Python, and MySQL into the virtual machine
Step 3: Configure Jupyter notebook in the Virtual machine instance
Step 4: Read training and test data from MySQL Server
Step 5: Perform data cleaning steps
Step 6: Perform Exploratory data analysis
Step 7: Build various tree-based models
Step 8: Evaluate the performance of each model using various performance metrics
Step 9: Perform predictions on the best model
