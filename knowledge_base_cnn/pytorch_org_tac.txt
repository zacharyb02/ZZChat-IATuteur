# Technical Advisory Council


### The PyTorch Foundation’s Technical Advisory Council (TAC) provides a forum for technical communication, leadership, and collaboration for the PyTorch Foundation. The committee members are members of the PyTorch Foundation.
The TAC holds open meetings once a month that anyone in the community can attend. The committee provides thought leadership on technical topics, knowledge sharing, and a forum to discuss issues with other technical experts in the community.


## Resources
- Attend a TAC meeting (Public calendar)
- Access TAC presentations and meeting recordings (TAC list-serv)
- Getting started with the PyTorch Foundation
- Attend DeepSpeed virtual office hours

### Jeff Daily
Jeff Daily is a Fellow at AMD and the chief architect of the Machine Learning Software Engineering group supporting ML frameworks such as PyTorch and onnxruntime on AMD GPUs. He enjoys delivering open source software to answer the challenges of the rapidly-changing ML landscape. For over five years, he has contributed to the PyTorch core as well as its extension libraries. His sustained contributions earned him the first ever Linux Foundation PyTorch Award “for excellence in long-term contributions across all PyTorch modalities.” Though he has not achieved the status of maintainer, Jeff is a trusted contributor. Jeff’s technical leadership is one of the reasons PyTorch runs out of the box without any code modifications on AMD GPUs. In addition to PyTorch technical contributions, Jeff is the AMD representative for the PyTorch Foundation’s Technical Advisory Committee.

### Luca Antiga
Luca Antiga is the CTO at Lightning AI. He is an early contributor to PyTorch core and co-authored “Deep Learning with PyTorch” (published by Manning). He started his journey as a researcher in Bioengineering, and later co-founded Orobix, a company focused on building and deploying AI in production settings.


### Milos Puzovic
Milos Puzovic is Technical Director at Arm where he is working on accelerating machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch on AArch64. In the past, he worked on designing and developing infrastructure for rapid development and deployment to edge devices and cloud of novel neural models that were trained using semi-supervised approach. He also has interest in optimizing applications through hardware and software co-design by using machine learning, code generation, optimization and verification of high-level models for different types of architecture. Milos has PhD in Computer Science from University of Cambridge where his thesis was on hardware/software interface for dynamic multicore scheduling and BSc with First Class Honors in Joint Mathematics and Computer Science from Imperial College London.


### Olatunji Ruwase
Olatunji (Tunji) Ruwase is a Principal Engineer at Snowflake, where he focuses on building high-performance AI infrastructure and systems for large-scale training and inference. Prior to joining Snowflake, he was a co-founder and lead of the DeepSpeed project at Microsoft, where his research and engineering contributions advanced the state of deep learning optimization across distributed training, inference, and hyperparameter tuning. His work has been deployed in key Microsoft products including Bing, Ads, HyperDrive, and Catapult. Tunji holds a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and brings a deep background in compilers, operating systems, and hardware accelerators.


### Piotr Bialecki
Piotr joined PyTorch team at NVIDIA in 2019 and currently manages the team. He drives NVIDIA’s effort in maintaining and advancing PyTorch’s CUDA backend and received the PyTorch SUPERHERO award in 2023 for his community contributions especially in the PyTorch discussion board. As a Core Maintainer, he is also focussed on PyTorch’s long-term vision and development.


### Ricardo Aravena
Ricardo is a seasoned technology leader with over two decades of experience across the enterprise and startup landscape. He works at Snowflake as a Cloud Infrastructure and Open Source Lead, focusing on automating AI/ML infrastructure using cloud-native technologies at scale. A passionate open source advocate, Ricardo also serves as a shadow member of the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee and CNCF AI Sub-project, where he helps shape the future of AI computing infrastructure.
Throughout his career, Ricardo has held key engineering and leadership roles at major companies such as Rakuten, Cisco, and VMware, as well as at innovative startups including Truera, Branch Metrics, Coupa, HyTrust, Exablox, and SnapLogic. He’s committed to community-driven innovation and regularly contributes to industry initiatives that bridge the gap between open source communities and enterprise adoption.
