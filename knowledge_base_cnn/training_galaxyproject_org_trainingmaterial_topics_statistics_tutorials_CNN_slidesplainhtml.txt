Speaker Notes
# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Increasing popularity of social media in past decade Image and video processing tasks have become very important
- Image and video processing tasks have become very important
- FNN could not scale up to image and video processing tasks
- CNN specifically tailored for image and video processing tasks
# Feedforward neural networks (FNN)
- In FNN all nodes in a layer connected to all nodes in next layer Each connection has a weight, must be learned by learning algorithm
- Each connection has a weight, must be learned by learning algorithm
# Limitations of FNN
- If input is 64 pixel by 64 pixel grayscale image Each grayscale pixel represented by 1 value, usually between 0 to 255 Where 0 is black, 255 is white, and values in between are shades of gray
- Each grayscale pixel represented by 1 value, usually between 0 to 255
- Where 0 is black, 255 is white, and values in between are shades of gray
- Since each grayscale pixel represented by 1 value, we say channel size is 1
- Image represented by 64 x 64 x 1 = 4,096 values (rows x columns x channels) Hence, input layer of FNN has 4096 nodes
- Hence, input layer of FNN has 4096 nodes
- Lets assume next layer has 500 nodes Since FNN fully connected, we have 4,096 x 500 = 2,048,000 weights
- Since FNN fully connected, we have 4,096 x 500 = 2,048,000 weights
- For complex problems, we need multiple hidden layers in our FNN Compunds the problem of having many weights
- Compunds the problem of having many weights
- Having too many weights Makes learning more difficult as dimension of search space is increased Makes training more time/resource consuming Increases the likelihood of overfitting
- Makes learning more difficult as dimension of search space is increased
- Makes training more time/resource consuming
- Increases the likelihood of overfitting
- Problem is further compunded for color images Each pixel in color image represented by 3 values (RGB color mode) Since each pixel represented by 3 values, we say channel size is 3 Image represented by 64 x 64 x 3 = 12,288 values (rows x columns x channels) Number of weights is now 12,288 x 500 = 6,144,000
- Each pixel in color image represented by 3 values (RGB color mode)
- Since each pixel represented by 3 values, we say channel size is 3
- Image represented by 64 x 64 x 3 = 12,288 values (rows x columns x channels)
- Number of weights is now 12,288 x 500 = 6,144,000
- Clear that FNN cannot scale to larger images (Too many weights)
- Another problem with FNN 2D image represented as 1D vector in input layer Any spatial relationship in the data is ignored
- 2D image represented as 1D vector in input layer
- Any spatial relationship in the data is ignored

# Architecture of CNN
- A typical CNN has 4 layers Input layer Convolution layer Pooling layer Fully connected layer
- Input layer
- Convolution layer
- Pooling layer
- Fully connected layer
- We will explain a 2D CNN here Same concepts apply to a 1 (or 3) dimensional CNN
- Same concepts apply to a 1 (or 3) dimensional CNN
- Example input a 28 pixel by 28 pixel grayscale image
- Unlike FNN, we do not “flatten” the input to a 1D vector Input is presented to network in 2D as 28 x 28 matrix This makes capturing spatial relationships easier
- Input is presented to network in 2D as 28 x 28 matrix
- This makes capturing spatial relationships easier
- Composed of multiple filters (kernels)
- Filters for 2D image are also 2D
- Suppose we have a 3 by 3 filter (9 values in total) Values are randomly set to 0 or 1
- Values are randomly set to 0 or 1
- Convolution: placing 3 by 3 filter on the top left corner of image Multiply filter values by pixel values, add the results Move filter to right one pixel at a time, and repeat this process When at top right corner, move filter down one pixel and repeat process Process ends when we get to bottom right corner of image
- Multiply filter values by pixel values, add the results
- Move filter to right one pixel at a time, and repeat this process
- When at top right corner, move filter down one pixel and repeat process
- Process ends when we get to bottom right corner of image
# 3 by 3 Filter
# Convolution operator parameters
- Filter size
- Padding
- Stride
- Dilation
- Activation function
- Filter size can be 5 by 5, 3 by 3, and so on
- Larger filter sizes should be avoided As learning algorithm needs to learn filter values (weights)
- As learning algorithm needs to learn filter values (weights)
- Odd sized filters are preferred to even sized filters Nice geometric property of all input pixels being around output pixel
- Nice geometric property of all input pixels being around output pixel
- After applying 3 by 3 filter to 4 by 4 image, we get a 2 by 2 image
– Size of the image has gone down
- If we want to keep image size the same, we can use padding We pad input in every direction with 0’s before applying filter If padding is 1 by 1, then we add 1 zero in evey direction If padding is 2 by 2, then we add 2 zeros in every direction, and so on
- We pad input in every direction with 0’s before applying filter
- If padding is 1 by 1, then we add 1 zero in evey direction
- If padding is 2 by 2, then we add 2 zeros in every direction, and so on
# 3 by 3 filter with padding of 1
- How many pixels we move filter to the right/down is stride
- Stride 1: move filter one pixel to the right/down
- Stride 2: move filter two pixels to the right/down
# 3 by 3 filter with stride of 2
- When we apply 3 by 3 filter, output affected by pixels in 3 by 3 subset of image
- Dilation: To have a larger receptive field (portion of image affecting filter’s output)
- If dilation set to 2, instead of contiguous 3 by 3 subset of image, every other pixel of a 5 by 5 subset of image affects output
# 3 by 3 filter with dilation of 2
- After filter applied to whole image, apply activation function to output to introduce non-linearlity
- Preferred activation function in CNN is ReLU
- ReLU leaves outputs with positive values as is, replaces negative values with 0
# Relu activation function
# Single channel 2D convolution
# Triple channel 2D convolution
# Triple channel 2D convolution in 3D
# Change channel size
- Output of a multi-channel 2D filter is a single channel 2D image
- Applying multiple filters results in a multi-channel 2D image
- E.g., if input image is 28 x 28 x 3 (rows x columns x channels) We apply a 3 x 3 filter with 1 x 1 padding, we get a 28 x 28 x 1 image If we apply 15 such filters, we get a 28 x 28 x 15
- We apply a 3 x 3 filter with 1 x 1 padding, we get a 28 x 28 x 1 image
- If we apply 15 such filters, we get a 28 x 28 x 15
- Number of filters allows us to increase or decrease channel size
- Pooling layer performs down sampling to reduce spatial dimensionality of input
- This decreases number of parameters Reduces learning time/computation Reduces likelihood of overfitting
- Reduces learning time/computation
- Reduces likelihood of overfitting
- Most popular type is max pooling Usually a 2 x 2 filter with a stride of 2 Returns maximum value as it slides over input data
- Usually a 2 x 2 filter with a stride of 2
- Returns maximum value as it slides over input data

# An example CNN
- A typical CNN has several convolution plus pooling layers Each responsible for feature extraction at different levels of abstraction E.g., filters in first layer detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edges Filters in the next layer detect shapes Filters in the last layer detect collection of shapes
- Each responsible for feature extraction at different levels of abstraction
- E.g., filters in first layer detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edges
- Filters in the next layer detect shapes
- Filters in the last layer detect collection of shapes
- Filter values randomly initialized, learned by learning algorithm
- CNN not only do classification, but can also automatically do feature extraction Distinguishes CNN from other classification techniques (like Support Vector Machines)
- Distinguishes CNN from other classification techniques (like Support Vector Machines)
# MNIST dataset

- Composed of training set of 60,000 and test set of 10,000 images
- Digits have been size-normalized/centered in a fixed-size image (28 by 28 pixels)
- Images are grayscale Each pixel is represented by a number between 0 and 255 0 for black, 255 for white, and other values for shades of gray
- Each pixel is represented by a number between 0 and 255
- 0 for black, 255 for white, and other values for shades of gray
