## Project Description
Business Objective
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is based on DevOps principles and practices that increase the efficiency of workflows. For example, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment. MLOps enables the automated management of the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. The main goal of MLOps is the faster deployment of models in production.
We will be using Azure as our cloud platform. Microsoft Azure provides many robust services in its ecosystem to create an end-to-end MLOps pipeline. In this project, we will be deploying our time-series deep learning model on the Azure cloud platform in a multi-part format.
Aim
To create an MLOps project using the Microsoft Azure platform to deploy a deep learning model in production. Terraform is used alongside the Azure UI to automate the creation of Azure resources of the project. In this step, you will learn how terraform script deploy all required Azure Services. Please follow instructions.md file in the terraform code folder to execute terraform.
