By the end of this course, learners will be able to design, build, train, and evaluate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using Python, gaining hands-on experience in one of the most in-demand deep learning skills. You will learn to set up both local and cloud-based environments, preprocess and augment image datasets, implement CNN architectures, and assess model accuracy and performance.
Through structured lessons, coding exercises, and real-world projects, you’ll develop not only the theoretical foundation but also the practical ability to apply CNNs to tasks like image classification. Each concept is reinforced with quizzes and guided implementations, ensuring immediate feedback and skill mastery.
What makes this course unique is its project-driven, modular approach—every step from data preparation to prediction workflows is directly tied to Python code, with clear, reproducible results. Whether you’re new to deep learning or transitioning from basic machine learning, this course equips you with job-ready CNN skills to confidently tackle modern AI challenges.
This module introduces learners to the essential foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python, covering project setup, CNN architecture, coding, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. By the end, learners will be equipped to design, implement, and test CNN models for real-world image classification tasks.

## Frequently asked questions
To access the course materials, assignments and to earn a Certificate, you will need to purchase the Certificate experience when you enroll in a course.  You can try a Free Trial instead, or apply for Financial Aid. The course may offer 'Full Course, No Certificate' instead. This option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade. This also means that you will not be able to purchase a Certificate experience.
When you enroll in the course, you get access to all of the courses in the Specialization, and you earn a certificate when you complete the work. Your electronic Certificate will be added to your Accomplishments page - from there, you can print your Certificate or add it to your LinkedIn profile.
Yes. In select learning programs, you can apply for financial aid or a scholarship if you can’t afford the enrollment fee. If fin aid or scholarship is available for your learning program selection, you’ll find a link to apply on the description page.
