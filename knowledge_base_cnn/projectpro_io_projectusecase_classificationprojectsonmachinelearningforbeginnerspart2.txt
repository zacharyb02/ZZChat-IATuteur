## Project Description
## Overview
In machine learning, Classification is one of the most widely used techniques with various applications. For sentiment analysis, spam detection, risk assessment, churn prediction, and medical diagnosis classification have served as a very simple yet powerful method. In this project, we aim to give you hands-on experience and theoretical explanations of various ensemble techniques. You can find the first project of this series here .
### Aim
Understanding various Ensemble techniques and implementing them to predict license status for the given business.
### Data Description
The dataset used is a licensed dataset. It contains information about 86K different businesses over various features. The target variable is the status of the license, which has five different categories.
### Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, scikit_learn, category_encoders, numpy, os, seaborn, matplotlib, hyperopt, xgboost
