## Customer Reviews
ProjectPro is a unique platform and helps many people in the industry to solve real-life problems with a step-by-step walkthrough of projects. A platform with some fantastic resources to gain hands-on experience and prepare for job interviews. I would highly recommend this platform to anyone looking to upskill and stay updated with the latest projects and solutions. Overall this platform is awesome and worth the money spent as we get a lot of value out of it and helps soar our career to greater heights.
Having worked in the field of Data Science, I wanted to explore how I can implement projects in other domains, So I thought of connecting with ProjectPro. A project that helped me absorb this topic was "Credit Risk Modelling". To understand other domains, it is important to wear a thinking cap and that's where ProjectPro helped me. I also got a chance to talk to experts who have worked on these domains - they helped me by walking through the project. Kudos to the ProjectPro team!
ProjectPro is an awesome platform that helps me learn much hands-on industrial experience with a step-by-step walkthrough of projects. There are two primary paths to learn: Data Science and Big Data. In each learning path, there are many customized projects with all the details from the beginner to the expert. As a new data science learner, you can just follow these projects to master the important techniques quickly. It is really helpful for both my research and job searching. Hope you can come and join ProjectPro to win a great future for yourself.
I come from a background in Marketing and Analytics and when I developed an interest in Machine Learning algorithms, I did multiple in-class courses from reputed institutions though I got good theoretical knowledge, the practical approach, real word application, and deployment knowledge were missing. ProjectPro helped me bridge that gap. ProjectPro has real-time projects that helped me improve my skills. What I liked most is that I get exposure to so many projects, given the work nature I wouldn't have gotten exposure to such a variety of projects and their approaches. It is helping me apply knowledge to other projects too. I highly recommend ProjectPro to everyone who wants to excel in their DataScience career.
I come from Northwestern University, which is ranked 9th in the US. Although the high-quality academics at school taught me all the basics I needed, obtaining practical experience was a challenge. This is when I was introduced to ProjectPro, and the fact that I am on my second subscription year only goes to prove that the ROI is satisfactory.
I managed to switch to analytics companies, only because of the relevant practical experience this product served me with. I now work at a leading healthcare startup as a Senior Analytics Consultant.
I am a customer who is not only satisfied with ProjectPro but also mighty impressed by how Dezyre bends over backward to ensure customer satisfaction. I have had a couple of interactions with Binny and each time I was left happy and content. I also had a conversation with their investors, and I was really glad to articulate my appreciation of the product.
They not only have enterprise-grade projects, but also set up 1:1 sessions with seasoned experts in case we get stuck, or are having trouble understanding a certain concept. As the cherry on the icing, there are experts to guide you with resume writing and interview preparation as well, to culminate the whole process of making you job-ready.
Kudos to ProjectPro!
I am the Director of Data Analytics with over 10+ years of IT experience. I have a background in SQL, Python, and Big Data working with Accenture, IBM, and Infosys. I am looking to enhance my skills in Data Engineering/Science and hoping to find real-world projects fortunately, I came across Project Pro. Project Pro helped me by providing an in-depth explanation of the end-to-end real-world data engineering projects. From data extraction, transformation, and storage up to data visualization. I learned more about Kafka, AWS, NI-FI, and Spark. Thru the help of the knowledge I gained from Project Pro, I was able to do well in the coding exams, interview and helped me land a job at EY. I will recommend every aspiring data professional as well as existing data science/engineer expert to try Project Pro to enhance their knowledge.
As a  student looking to break into the field of data engineering and data science, one can get really confused as to which path to take. Very few ways to do it are Google, YouTube, etc. I was one of them too, and that's when I came across ProjectPro while watching one of the SQL videos on the E-Learning Bridge YouTube channel. One of the standout features was that it featured real projects on topics  I  just read about, across different job descriptions at the time. The main issue was the right path to guide us in using these tools and adding to the resume, and that's exactly what ProjectPro got me through. The fact that I can have a reliable route and videos explaining each tool in detail really motivated me to continue with the platform. Another thing we all struggle with is how to really connect with someone if we're stuck somewhere because there are so many solutions. But this has also been solved by experts we can chat with and believe me when I say this they will do whatever it takes to solve your problem even if it takes longer than expected. In my sophomore year of college and getting hands-on exposure to technologies like PySpark, NLP, Kafka, etc, and being able to really apply the theory and work on a project from start to finish really boosted my confidence in general!
I think that they are fantastic. I attended Yale and Stanford and have worked at Honeywell,Oracle, and Arthur Andersen(Accenture) in the US. I have taken Big Data and Hadoop,NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop Admin, Hadoop projects. I have been happy with every project. They have really brought me into the forefront of Data Science and Big data. I would recommend this to everyone. It is more than worth the price. After working with them I feel so much more employable for current projects.
