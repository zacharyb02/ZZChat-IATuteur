Creates a constant tensor from a tensor-like object.


```python
tf.constant(
    value, dtype=None, shape=None, name='Const'
) -> Union[tf.Operation, ops._EagerTensorBase]
```




### Used in the notebooks
- Better performance with tf.function
- Introduction to graphs and tf.function
- Migrate `tf.feature_column`s to Keras preprocessing layers
- Playing CartPole with the Actor-Critic method
- Custom training loop with Keras and MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy
If the argument dtype is not specified, then the type is inferred from
the type of value .


```python
# Constant 1-D Tensor from a python list.
tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
<tf.Tensor: shape=(6,), dtype=int32,
    numpy=array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=int32)>
# Or a numpy array
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
tf.constant(a)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int64, numpy=
  array([[1, 2, 3],
         [4, 5, 6]])>
```


If dtype is specified, the resulting tensor values are cast to the requested dtype .


```python
tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=tf.float64)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(6,), dtype=float64,
    numpy=array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.])>
```


If shape is set, the value is reshaped to match. Scalars are expanded to
fill the shape :


```python
tf.constant(0, shape=(2, 3))
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32, numpy=
  array([[0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0]], dtype=int32)>
tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], shape=[2, 3])
<tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32, numpy=
  array([[1, 2, 3],
         [4, 5, 6]], dtype=int32)>
```


tf.constant has no effect if an eager Tensor is passed as the value , it
even transmits gradients:


```python
v = tf.Variable([0.0])
with tf.GradientTape() as g:
    loss = tf.constant(v + v)
g.gradient(loss, v).numpy()
array([2.], dtype=float32)
```


But, since tf.constant embeds the value in the tf.Graph this fails for
symbolic tensors:


```python
with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default():
  i = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(shape=[None, None], dtype=tf.float32)
  t = tf.constant(i)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: ...
```


tf.constant will create tensors on the current device. Inputs which are
already tensors maintain their placements unchanged.
- tf.convert_to_tensor is similar but: It has no shape argument. Symbolic tensors are allowed to pass through. with tf . compat . v1 . Graph () . as_default (): i = tf . compat . v1 . placeholder ( shape = [ None , None ], dtype = tf . float32 ) t = tf . convert_to_tensor ( i )
tf.convert_to_tensor is similar but:
- Symbolic tensors are allowed to pass through.


```python
with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default():
  i = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(shape=[None, None], dtype=tf.float32)
  t = tf.convert_to_tensor(i)
```


- tf.fill : differs in a few ways: tf.constant supports arbitrary constants, not just uniform scalar
Tensors like tf.fill . tf.fill creates an Op in the graph that is expanded at runtime, so it
can efficiently represent large tensors. Since tf.fill does not embed the value, it can produce dynamically
sized outputs.
