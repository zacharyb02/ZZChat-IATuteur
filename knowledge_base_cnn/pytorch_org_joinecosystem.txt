# Join the PyTorch Ecosystem


### The PyTorch Ecosystem is made up of innovative open source AI projects that extend, integrate with, or build upon PyTorch.
If you’re developing a project that supports the PyTorch community, you’re welcome to apply for inclusion in the Ecosystem. Please review the PyTorch Ecosystem review process to ensure that you meet the minimum expectations before applying.


## Application Process
Applying to join the PyTorch Ecosystem is simple:
- Open a new application using the Ecosystem Application GitHub issue form .
- Complete all required sections.
Once submitted, your application enters the review pipeline managed by the PyTorch Ecosystem Working Group.


## Review Workflow
All applications are tracked via the PyTorch Ecosystem Project Board.
Applications are reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis.
The Working Group reviews approximately 7–10 projects per session, depending on availability.
Projects are moved to “In Progress” roughly two weeks before a scheduled review session.
During review, Working Group members assess your application based on technical merit, alignment with the PyTorch mission, and community readiness. Questions and requests for clarification may be posted directly in your GitHub issue.
