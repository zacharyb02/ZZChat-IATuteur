## Project Description
Business Objective
OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. OpenCV has a modular structure, which means that the package includes several shared or static libraries.
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. When integrated with various libraries, such as “NumPy,” a highly optimized library for numerical operations, the number of weapons increases in your Arsenal, i.e., whatever operations one can do in NumPy can be combined with OpenCV.
It is advised to visit the basic OpenCV project OpenCV Project for Beginners to Learn Computer Vision Basics before starting.
Data Description
In this project, we will be using sample images and videos as our input data and perform various algorithms on top of it.
