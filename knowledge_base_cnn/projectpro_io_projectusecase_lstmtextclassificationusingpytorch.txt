## Project Description
Overview
Long short-term memory(LSTM) is a recurrent neural network architecture(RNN) used in the field of deep learning. These architectures are capable of learning long-term dependencies faced by recurrent neural networks. LSTMs have feedback connections which makes them different from the traditional feed-forward neural networks. LSTMs are particularly good at text data, speech, and time series.
In this project, an LSTM model for classifying the review of an app on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the feedback has been built in PyTorch. If you haven't visited already, here is the previous project of the series Build a CNN Model with PyTorch for Image Classification
Aim
- To understand the  working of LSTM
- To classify the review of an app on a scale of 1 to 5 using LSTM
Data Description
The dataset contains the reviews and the ratings of the app. The dataset has a score column and content column. The score columns have a number range between 1 to 5 based on the content column.
Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib, sci-kit learn, nltk, numpy, pytorch
