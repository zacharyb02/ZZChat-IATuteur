Global average pooling operation for 2D data.
Inherits From: Layer , Operation
Main aliases tf.keras.layers.GlobalAvgPool2D
tf.keras.layers.GlobalAvgPool2D


```python
tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(
    data_format=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs
)
```




### Used in the notebooks
- Pruning for on-device inference w/ XNNPACK
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning
- TFF simulations with accelerators


## Args
data_format string, either "channels_last" or "channels_first" .
The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. "channels_last" corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, height, width, channels) while "channels_first" corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, features, height, weight) . It defaults to the image_data_format value found in your Keras config file at ~/.keras/keras.json . If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last" . keepdims A boolean, whether to keep the temporal dimension or not.
If keepdims is False (default), the rank of the tensor is
reduced for spatial dimensions. If keepdims is True , the
spatial dimension are retained with length 1.
The behavior is the same as for tf.reduce_mean or np.mean .
- If data_format='channels_last' :
4D tensor with shape: (batch_size, height, width, channels)
- If data_format='channels_first' :
4D tensor with shape: (batch_size, channels, height, width)
- If keepdims=False :
2D tensor with shape (batch_size, channels) .
- If keepdims=True : If data_format="channels_last" :
4D tensor with shape (batch_size, 1, 1, channels) If data_format="channels_first" :
4D tensor with shape (batch_size, channels, 1, 1)
- If data_format="channels_last" :
4D tensor with shape (batch_size, 1, 1, channels)
- If data_format="channels_first" :
4D tensor with shape (batch_size, channels, 1, 1)


```python
x = np.random.rand(2, 4, 5, 3)
y = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
y.shape
(2, 3)
```




## Attributes
input Retrieves the input tensor(s) of a symbolic operation.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called. output Retrieves the output tensor(s) of a layer.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called.


## Methods


### from_config


```python
@classmethod
from_config(
    config
)
```


Creates a layer from its config.
This method is the reverse of get_config ,
capable of instantiating the same layer from the config
dictionary. It does not handle layer connectivity
(handled by Network), nor weights (handled by set_weights ).
config A Python dictionary, typically the
output of get_config.


### symbolic_call


```python
symbolic_call(
    *args, **kwargs
)
```
