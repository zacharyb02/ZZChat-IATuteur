## Source code + Project materials
## Project Description
Objective:
Autoencoders are used to learn compressed representations of raw data with Encoder and decoder as sub-parts. As a part of a series of Deep Learning projects, this project briefs about Autoencoders and its architecture. In this project, we build a deep learning model based on Autoencoders for Anomaly detection and deploy it using Flask. If you haven’t already visited, here is the previous project of the series Deep Learning Project for Beginners with Source Code Part 1 .
Aim :
- To understand the theory behind Autoencoders
- To develop a deep learning model based on Autoencoders to learn distributions and relationships between features of normal transactions
- To deploy the model using Flask
Data Overview:
The dataset used is a transaction dataset, and it contains information for more than 100K transactions over several features.
Tech Stack:
- Language: Python
- Packages: Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, Keras, Tensorflow
- API service: Flask, Gunicorn
Approach
- Understand business objective
- Understand the data using EDA
- Normalize and clean the data using Imputation
- Understand idea behind Auto-encoders
- Build a base auto-encoder model using Keras
- Tune the model to extract the best performance
- Extract predictions
- Serve model as API endpoint using Flask
- Perform real-time predictions
