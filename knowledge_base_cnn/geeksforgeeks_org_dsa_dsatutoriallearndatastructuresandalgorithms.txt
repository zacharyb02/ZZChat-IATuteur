# DSA Tutorial
DSA stands for D ata S tructures and A lgorithms. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed. Algorithms focus on processing this data.  Examples of data structures are Array, Linked List, Tree and Heap, and examples of algorithms are Binary Search, Quick Sort and Merge Sort.
- Foundation for almost every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications, etc
- Top Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta and many other heavily focus on DSA i n interviews.
- Learning DSA boosts your problem-solving abilities and make you a stronger programmer.
Before beginning the DSA journey, it is recommended to learn at-least one programming language ( C++ , Java , Python , JavaScript or any other language of your choice).
Below are the recommended step by step topics to learn complete DSA.
### 1. Logic Building
Once you have learned basics of a programming language, it is recommended that you learn basic logic building
- Logic Building Guide
- Quiz on Logic Building
### 2. Learn about Complexities
To analyze algorithms, we mainly measure order of growth of time or space taken in terms of input size.  We do this in the worst case scenario in most of the cases. Please refer the below links for a clear understanding of these concepts.

### 3. Array
Array is a linear data structure where elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access.
- Array Guide
- Array Quiz
### 4. Searching Algorithms
Searching algorithms are used to locate specific data within a large set of data. It helps find a target value within the data. There are various types of searching algorithms, each with its own approach and efficiency.
- Searching Guide
- Quiz on Searching
### 5. Sorting Algorithm
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange the elements of a list in a specific order, such as numerical or alphabetical. It organizes the items in a systematic way, making it easier to search for and access specific elements.

### 6. Hashing
Hashing is a technique that generates a fixed-size output (hash value) from an input of variable size using mathematical formulas called hash functions. Hashing is commonly used in data structures for efficient searching, insertion and deletion.

- Quiz on Hashing
### 7. Two Pointer Technique
I n Two Pointer Technique, we typically use two index variables from two corners of an array. We use the two pointer technique for searching a required point or value in an array.

### 8. Window Sliding Technique
I n Window Sliding Technique, we use the result of previous subarray to quickly compute the result of current.

### 9. Prefix Sum Technique
I n Prefix Sum Technique, we compute prefix sums of an array to quickly find results for a subarray.

### 11. Recursion
A programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. It is usually used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.
- Recursion Guide
- Quiz on Recursion
### 12. Matrix/Grid
A two-dimensional array of elements, arranged in rows and columns . It is represented as a rectangular grid, with each element at the intersection of a row and column.
- Matrix Guide
- Quiz on Matrix/Grid.
### 13. Linked List
A linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers. Unlike arrays, nodes of linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations and can only be accessed sequentially , starting from the head of list.
- Linked List Guide
- Quiz on Linked List
### 14. Stack
A linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Stacks play an important role in managing function calls, memory, and are widely used in algorithms like stock span problem, next greater element and largest area in a histogram.
- Stack Guide
- Quiz on Stack
### 15. Queue
Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Queues play an important role in managing tasks or data in order, scheduling and message handling systems.
- Queue Guide
- Quiz on Queue
### 16. Deque
A Deque or double-ended queue is a data structure that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends efficiently.
- Deque Guide
- Quiz on Deque
### 17. Tree
A non-linear, hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a top node called the root and nodes having child nodes. It is widely used in file systems , databases , decision-making algorithms , etc.
- Tree Guide
- Quiz on Tree
### 18. Heap
A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property . Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues , where the smallest or largest element is always at the root of the tree.
- Heap Guide
- Quiz on Heap
### 19. Graph
A non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges (or links)that connect a pair of nodes. Graphs are widely used to represent relationships between entities.
- Graph Guide
- Quiz on Graph
### 20. Greedy Algorithm
Greedy Algorithm builds up the solution one piece at a time and chooses the next piece which gives the most obvious and immediate benefit i.e., which is the most optimal choice at that moment. So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to the global solutions are best fit for Greedy.
- Greedy Algorithms Guide

### 21. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a method used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems . By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.

Branch and Bound : Used in combinatorial optimization problems to systematically search for the best solution. It works by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, or branches, and then eliminating certain branches based on bounds on the optimal solution. This process continues until the best solution is found or all branches have been explored.
