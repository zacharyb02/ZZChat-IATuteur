## Project Description
This machine learning project in Python entails building a collaborative filtering recommender system by employing a memory-based technique of distance proximity using cosine distance and nearest neighbors. The project leverages the Amazon Reviews/Rating dataset containing 2 Million records. This project will introduce you to the concept of recommendation systems, collaborative filtering algorithms, cosine similarity, etc.
Whether you browse a YouTube video, a Netflix movie, or an Amazon product, you will come across a collaborative filtering recommendation system that suggests what content to watch, like, or purchase. But how do these collaborative filtering systems work? This recommender system project explores the working of collaborative filtering systems in detail.
A recommender system improves overall customer experience, average order value, conversion, and retention. Barilliance shows that product recommendation systems can account for up to 31% of revenue growth. A report from Accenture shows that personalization raises a customer’s likelihood of making a purchase.
Given the vast scope of recommender engines in the industry, this machine learning project focuses on a significant recommender approach called collaborative filtering, which filters the content using user interactions and data that the system acquires from other users.
## Collaborative Filtering Recommender System PythonProject Description
Recommendation systems are integral to many online systems, from e-commerce to streaming platforms. Recommendation engines employ the past purchase pattern of its user to predict which other products they may be interested in and likely to purchase. Recommending the right products gives a significant advantage to the business since a major portion of the revenue is generated through recommendations.
The Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm is popular on online streaming platforms and e-commerce sites. Customers interact with each product (a movie/ song or a consumer product) by either liking/ disliking or rating. Collaborative filtering systems mainly apply the similarity index-based technique where they select some users depending on their resemblance to the active user. A requirement for collaborative filtering is past user preferences for a particular group of items. Since it relies majorly on historical data, the fundamental principle here is that users with similar interests in the past tend to have the same interests in the future.
The collaborative recommender approach divides user preferences into two categories. Explicit rating refers to the user's rating of an item on a sliding scale, and this is direct feedback about how much entertainment a product invokes. Implicit rating represents implicit feedback through actions like page views, clicks, record purchases, etc.
This recommender system project walks you through the implementation of collaborative filtering using a memory-based technique of distance proximity using cosine distance and nearest neighbors.
## Types of Collaborative Filtering Algorithms
There are two types of collaborative filtering approaches- memory-based and model-based.
## 1. Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
The memory-based CF technique uses a rating system to forecast a user’s preferences by considering the likes of similar users or ‘neighbors.’ Only the user-item matrix is used in memory-based collaborative filtering to provide users with the latest recommendations. The entire approach relies on the users' past user ratings and interactions.
User-based and item-based collaborative filtering are the two types of memory-based collaborative filtering approaches to predict ratings.
- User-Based Collaborative Filtering
User-user collaborative filtering focuses on similar users depending on user interest, contacts, and demographics. Social networking sites use this method to suggest users to other users based on their behavior patterns.
Let us consider an example to understand the user-user collaborative filtering approach better.
- The first step in the user-user recommendation approach is to create a user-item matrix depending on the similar interests of two users or the interest of a specific user in a particular item, such as the fact that user A purchased apples, bananas, and pears, whereas user B bought bananas and watermelons. Here, user A and user B purchase the same item- bananas.
- The second step is determining the set of users with the same interest or similar to the target user using the item matrix's cosine similarity. The cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar two entities or products are regardless of their size.
- Lastly, the K-Nearest Neighbor method helps calculate similarity using the user-item matrix. The user CF algorithm predicts the target user's rating/interest scores for unidentified items in the training data to offer recommendations.
Additionally, you can calculate the user ratings using the weighted average method. To calculate the weighted average, multiply each rating by a similarity factor (which tells how similar two users are).
- Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
The item-based filtering approach selects new recommendations depending on the past interactions relevant to the target user. It prioritizes all the items the particular user has previously used/liked. After that, it assesses similar products with similar ratings and forms clusters (nearest neighbors). It then offers new recommendations from these clusters to the target user.
E-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart use item-based recommendation algorithms to suggest similar products to the target user by filtering them based on the user's interest or previous interaction data. Item-based filtering is faster and more efficient than user-based collaborative filtering in situations with more items than target users. It works smoothly because the average rating an item receives typically doesn't fluctuate as quickly as the average rating the same user gives other items. It also performs better than the user-user approach when the rating matrix is sparse.
Cosine similarity refers to the cosine value of the angle between two vectors in an n-dimensional area. It evaluates how similar two items or products are to one another regardless of their size or shape. Cosine similarity is the result of dividing the dot product of the two vectors by the magnitude of each vector.
The below equation represents cosine similarity.
Let us take an example to understand item-based CF better.
Suppose you want to predict the rating of user id 2 on item 2 in the cosine similarity matrix below.
You must follow the steps below to predict the rating.
- Determine the products that user 2 co-rated, items 1 and 4.
- Determine how closely item 2 and item 1 are similar.
- Use the similarity and co-rated rating to calculate the prediction such that,
where w stands for similarity and r for rating.
## 2. Model-Based Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
The model-based method uses machine learning models to predict and assess user interactions with products they haven't yet engaged with. This approach trains the models by applying various algorithms to the user-item matrix, including matrix factorization, deep learning, clustering, etc.
### Matrix Factorization Based Algorithms
Matrix factorization is an advanced technique that divides the initial sparse matrix into low-dimensional matrices with latent factors and features and less sparsity.
Consider a movie example. Suppose you have a rating matrix with five users and five movies, with ratings from 1 to 5:
You end up with a sparse matrix since not every user watches and rates each movie. Additionally, you can make the following assumptions while developing a model for your rating matrix:
- There are latent qualities that can distinguish between good and bad movies.
- These features might help you analyze user preferences (the higher the value, the higher the preference).
Instead of directly specifying these features, you allow the model to find the useful features on its own and create its user-item factor matrices. Furthermore, you can use other factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (as there are no negative values in ratings), etc.
## Pros Of Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Systems
### 1. Versatility
CF engines are more flexible than other search engines as you can use them in any domain, and, with some adjustments, they might also offer recommendations across multiple domains. In contrast, the challenge with content-based engines' expansion to other domains is that they need item metadata, which necessitates domain modeling.
### 2. Highly Efficient
Users building connections across subspaces in the product space may make CF engines more efficient and reliable at guiding the user in overcoming the "filter bubble" challenge.
### 3. Minimal Data Requirements
CF recommendation engines do not require extensive features and contextual information about products or services; they simply need the user-item matrix to train the matrix factorization model. In contrast, the Content-based filtering approach requires a complete analysis of a user's profile and preference.
## Cons of Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems
### 1. Data Sparsity
Data sparsity is a significant drawback of collaborative filtering recommender systems. It often leads to the cold start problem, highlighting the challenges in making recommendations when the users or the products are new. Why so? The working of a collaborative filtering system depends on the user's past data and item interactions on the site. However, there isn't enough historical data for new users and products to work correctly. As a result of this limitation, you might struggle to provide new users with a solid impression of your company by failing to deliver an excellent, tailored shopping experience.
### 2. Extensibility
Traditional CF algorithms typically experience significant scaling issues. Collaborative algorithms will tend to perform worse when the number of users grows and the volume of data expands because of the sheer volume of data growth.
### 3. Lack of Diversity
In theory, collaborative filters should increase diversity by introducing more options to consumers. However, some may unintentionally have the opposite impact. This method doesn’t recommend products with minimal or no historical data because it draws recommendations on past ratings or sales. A successful product will become even more popular as more customers view and buy it, pushing new products to the back of the line. In other words, this strategy may lead to a lack of variation for well-known products by having a rich-get-richer effect.
## When Should You Use Collaborative Filtering Recommender System?
Some of the most suitable use-cases for a collaborative filtering system include-
### 1. E-commerce Platforms
E-commerce companies can utilize CFRS to boost sales and enhance customer satisfaction. They can attempt to predict user preference by analyzing the query search and click data. These businesses can offer customer recommendations according to the cluster models produced by the query-based and item-to-item systems.
### 2. Online Video Streaming Platforms
Online video streaming providers can employ CFRS to generate customized suggestions to help consumers identify videos that are suitable to their interests. Due to the significance of retaining user engagement, these platforms update the recommendations often to reflect each user's behavior on the website and display the wide variety of available content. They can gather and compile data on users' viewing patterns and employ collaborative filtering to choose hundreds of videos. This candidate generation process trains the model using user feedback, and they then rank the selected videos to provide consumers with recommendations.
### 3. Music Streaming Platforms
Music streaming services operate by examining the billions of playlists that users have made, each reflecting the listener's unique preferences. They then combine this data with the playlists generated by the company and fill in the gaps by comparing a user's listening patterns to those of other users with similar likes. In addition to deep learning techniques and collaborative filtering, the method uses pattern recognition to identify trends in vast amounts of data and enhance daily/weekly/monthly selections.
## Real-World Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems Examples
### 1. Amazon
Amazon is a retail and e-commerce platform that connects buyers and sellers worldwide to sell various goods. Amazon incorporates the collaborative filtering technique into its recommendation engine and other artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for better performance and improved user interaction. Amazon offers a user-based approach and an item-based strategy for recommended products and related items. The platform prefers item-based collaborative filtering over a user-based system to provide high-quality recommendations. Collaborative filtering initially only used one method, a user-based method. However, Amazon was the one to create an item-based approach that focused on products rather than users. Overall, the platform's item-based collaborative filtering has proved to be a practical approach that has fueled the company's ability to generate a profit.
### 2. Meta (Earlier Facebook)
Meta is a social networking platform introduced in 2004 to bring individuals from different parts of the world together. Collaborative filtering is a crucial strategy for finding friends or for target marketing-suggested friends. Additionally, Meta uses many recommender engines for various sections of the website. For instance, the News and Marketplace sections employ different recommender engines to give information it believes will be helpful to the user. In contrast, the user timeline may use a single algorithm.
### 3. Netflix
Since 1997, Netflix, one of the most popular OTT platforms in the world, has been famous for its massive entertainment library and cutting-edge OTT content. Thanks to a collaborative filtering movie recommendation system, the site, which has millions of users worldwide, offers its users a variety of choices. The foundation of the Netflix product is its recommendation algorithms. Netflix employs recommendation systems powered by collaborative filtering methods to narrow the alternatives available for users and tailor its recommendations to match their interests.

## FAQs on Collaborative Filtering Recommender System
### 1. What is meant by collaborative filtering in recommender system?
Collaborative filtering in recommender systems refers to identifying similar users and offering suggestions they like. Instead of using the product's characteristics to recommend it, this approach classifies users into clusters of individuals with similar traits. It then makes recommendations for each based on its cluster's preferences.
### 2. What are the types of collaborative filtering in recommender systems?
There are two types of collaborative filtering in recommender systems- memory-based and model-based. Memory-based CF employs the user's past data based on ranking to determine how similar users or products are to one another. Model-based CF uses computer algorithms to forecast and determine how a customer rates each product.
### 3. What is a collaborative recommendation system?
A collaborative recommendation system only considers past customer interactions and the products they have used when recommending new products. It considers all users with similar tastes and preferences are used to make new and targeted product recommendations to the primary customer.
