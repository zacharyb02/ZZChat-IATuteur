## Project Description
## Introduction to YOLO Fruit Detection Project
In the rapid development of technology, significant concerns are given to the food we consume. One of the most cost-demanding factors in the agriculture industry is skilled labor. The industry is moving towards automation to decrease work costs and increase quality. Robotic harvesting can provide potential solutions to many such problems the industry faces. There are numerous challenging tasks to be fulfilled by the upcoming technology, one of them being an accurate fruit detection system. Different technologies have been used for fruit recognition using emerging computer vision technologies.
The particular project discusses building a robust model for fruit detection. There can be many advanced use cases for this, and some of them are:
- You are working in a warehouse where lakhs of fruits come in daily, and if you try to separate and package each of the fruit boxes manually, it will require a lot of workforce. So, you can build an automated system that can detect fruits and separate them for packaging.
- You are the owner of a vast orchid. If you want to harvest fruits from it manually, it will require a lot of workforce. You can build a robot or a self-driving truck that can detect fruits on specific trees and harvest them for you.
## Real-Time Custom Object Detection using YOLOv4 Project Overview
Here we give you a general layout of the YOLO v4 object detection project solution.
### Aim of the YOLOv4 Object Detection Project
To build a robust fruit detection system using the YOLOv4 object detection model.
### Fruit Object Detection Dataset
Suppose you are a newbie in data science and are looking for machine learning projects for beginners. In that case, we suggest you first work with Google’s Open Images Dataset and use the default YOLO v4 model. After completing that, you should move ahead with building a custom object detection model using YOLO v4. The dataset can be created by manually downloading the image using google search or by clicking the photographs of different fruits available.
### Tech Stack involved in this Object Detection Project
- Language: Python
- Object detection: YOLOv4
- Data annotation: LabelImg
- Environment: Google Colab
### Fruit Detection Python Code Roadmap
- Data Collection and Labeling with LabelImg
To create a custom object detector, we need an excellent dataset of images and labels so that the sensor can efficiently train to detect objects.
We can do this in two ways.
- Using Google's Open Images Dataset
We can gather thousands of images and their auto-generated labels within minutes. Explore that dataset here!
- Creating your dataset and then labeling it manually
We will create a dataset manually by collecting images from google image scraper or manually clicking them and then marking them using an image annotation tool, LabelImg .
- Building a YOLOv4 Object Detector with Darknet in the Cloud
- Enabling GPU within your notebook
- Cloning and Building Darknet
We are downloading AlexeyAB's famous repository and adjusting the Makefile to enable OPENCV and GPU for darknet and then build darknet.
- Demo on Pretrained model
YOLOv4 is trained on the coco dataset, which has 80 classes that it can predict. We will take these pre-trained weights to see how it results on some of the images.
- Customize YOLOv4 with the different command-line flags
- Threshold Flag
- Output Bounding Box Coordinates
- Don’t Show Image
- Multiple Images at Once
- Preparing dataset for training Yolo Labeled Custom Dataset Custom .cfg file
Preparing dataset for training Yolo
- Labeled Custom Dataset
- Custom .cfg file
Edit the yolov4.cfg for your custom model training using the google colab editor
- obj.data and obj.names files
Create a new file within a code or text editor called obj.names where you will have one class name per line
Example for multiclass obj.names file:
You will also create an obj.data file and fill it in accordingly.
- train.txt and test.txt file
The train.txt and test.txt files hold the relative paths to all our training and validation images.
- Train Your Custom Object Detector
- Training Yolo model from a checkpoint
- Model Evaluation using Mean Average Precision
- Predictions on images
- Predictions on Video
## Data Science Concepts to explore in this YOLOv4 Object Detection Project
Below you find the details of data science concepts that are discussed in this object detection project.
### Data Preprocessing
This project will build a system that can perform fruit detection using OpenCV code. And for that, you will first need to prepare the dataset for an object detection model like YOLO v4. This project will help you learn how to create that dataset and split it for training the model. Additionally, you will know how to split the dataset efficiently for testing and training purposes.
### Object Detection
Unlike image classification, object detection involves labeling parts of an image where the specific object is located. This project will teach you how to build a YOLOv4-based custom object detection model. You will explore the architecture and working of the YOLOv4 model in detail. Additionally, the project will teach you the reasoning behind the quirky acronym YOLO that stands for ‘You only look once’. Furthermore, you will learn how to download the pre-trained version of the model and tweak it to make it capable of fruit detection for your customized dataset. The project will also cover the evaluation of an object detection model using various statistical tools. Lastly, this project will guide you on implementing the object detection system over each frame of a live video.
### Transfer Learning
YOLO v4 is a pre-trained model that data scientists widely use for completing object detection tasks. It can only identify 20 objects, but one can build their customized object detection model using transfer learning. In this project, you will learn how to use your dataset and annotate it using the LabelImg tool. The project will help you understand the significance of data annotation for YOLOv4 transfer learning .
### FAQs on Custom Object Detection using YOLOv4
The YOLO model can detect 20 types of objects by default which include:
- Person
- Animals: bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep
- Vehicles: airplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train.
- Others: bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/monitor.
The YOLO object detection model doesn’t perform well when detecting a small object. The problem is that the feature map YOLO use has a very low resolution and the small object features get too small to be detectable.  However, one can improve the receptive field for YOLO by using image processing methods such as tiling.
