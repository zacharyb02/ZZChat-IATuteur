## How Does Computer Vision Work?
- Computer Vision works much like the human eye and brain. First, our eyes capture the image and send the visual data to our brain. The brain then processes this information and transforms it into a meaningful interpretation, recognizing and categorizing the object based on its properties.
- In a similar way, Computer Vision uses a camera (acting like the human eye) to capture images. The visual data is then processed by algorithms to recognize and identify the objects based on patterns it has learned. However, before the system can recognize objects in new images, it needs to be trained on a large dataset of labeled images. This training enables the system to identify and associate various patterns with their corresponding labels.
- For example, imagine providing a computer with thousands of bird song recordings. The system learns by analyzing features like pitch, rhythm and duration. Once trained, it can then recognize whether a new sound resembles a bird song or not.
