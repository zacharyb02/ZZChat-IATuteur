# Nystroem#
Approximate a kernel map using a subset of the training data.
Constructs an approximate feature map for an arbitrary kernel
using a subset of the data as basis.
Read more in the User Guide .
Added in version 0.13.
Kernel map to be approximated. A callable should accept two arguments
and the keyword arguments passed to this object as kernel_params , and
should return a floating point number.
Gamma parameter for the RBF, laplacian, polynomial, exponential chi2
and sigmoid kernels. Interpretation of the default value is left to
the kernel; see the documentation for sklearn.metrics.pairwise.
Ignored by other kernels.
Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
Ignored by other kernels.
Degree of the polynomial kernel. Ignored by other kernels.
Additional parameters (keyword arguments) for kernel function passed
as callable object.
Number of features to construct.
How many data points will be used to construct the mapping.
Pseudo-random number generator to control the uniform sampling without
replacement of n_components of the training data to construct the
basis kernel.
Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
See Glossary .
The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by breaking
down the kernel matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing them in
parallel.
None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details.
Added in version 0.24.
Subset of training points used to construct the feature map.
Indices of components_ in the training set.
Normalization matrix needed for embedding.
Square root of the kernel matrix on components_ .
Number of features seen during fit .
Names of features seen during fit . Defined only when X has feature names that are all strings.
Added in version 1.0.

Examples
```python
>>> from sklearn import datasets, svm
>>> from sklearn.kernel_approximation import Nystroem
>>> X, y = datasets.load_digits(n_class=9, return_X_y=True)
>>> data = X / 16.
>>> clf = svm.LinearSVC()
>>> feature_map_nystroem = Nystroem(gamma=.2,
...                                 random_state=1,
...                                 n_components=300)
>>> data_transformed = feature_map_nystroem.fit_transform(data)
>>> clf.fit(data_transformed, y)
LinearSVC()
>>> clf.score(data_transformed, y)

Fit estimator to data.
Samples a subset of training points, computes kernel
on these and computes normalization matrix.
Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples
and n_features is the number of features.
Target values (None for unsupervised transformations).
Returns the instance itself.
Fit to data, then transform it.
Fits transformer to X and y with optional parameters fit_params and returns a transformed version of X .
Input samples.
Additional fit parameters.
Pass only if the estimator accepts additional params in its fit method.
Transformed array.
Get output feature names for transformation.
The feature names out will prefixed by the lowercased class name. For
example, if the transformer outputs 3 features, then the feature names
out are: ["class_name0", "class_name1", "class_name2"] .
Only used to validate feature names with the names seen in fit .
Transformed feature names.
Get metadata routing of this object.
Please check User Guide on how the routing
mechanism works.
A MetadataRequest encapsulating
routing information.
Get parameters for this estimator.
If True, will return the parameters for this estimator and
contained subobjects that are estimators.
Parameter names mapped to their values.
Set output container.
See Introducing the set_output API for an example on how to use the API.
Configure output of transform and fit_transform .
- "default" : Default output format of a transformer
- "pandas" : DataFrame output
- "polars" : Polars output
- None : Transform configuration is unchanged
Added in version 1.4: "polars" option was added.
Estimator instance.
Set the parameters of this estimator.
The method works on simple estimators as well as on nested objects
(such as Pipeline ). The latter have
parameters of the form <component>__<parameter> so that it’s
possible to update each component of a nested object.
Estimator parameters.
Apply feature map to X.
Computes an approximate feature map using the kernel
between some training points and X.
Data to transform.
Transformed data.
