# Difference between Operating System and Kernel
In the world of computing, two terms that are frequently mentioned are Operating System (OS) and Kernel. In this article, we will explore the key differences between the OS and the Kernel, their functions, and how they work together to manage hardware and software.
## What is an Operating System?
An Operating System (OS) is the software that manages computer hardware, and software, and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware, making it easier for users to interact with the system without needing to understand the complex details of the hardware.
## What is a Kernel?
The Kernel is the core part of the operating system. It manages communication between the hardware and the software. It provides a user interface, file system management, network services, and various utility applications that allow users to interact with the system.
