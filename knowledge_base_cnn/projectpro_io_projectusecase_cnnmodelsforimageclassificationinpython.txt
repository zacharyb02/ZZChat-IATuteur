## Project Description
Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks are part of deep neural networks which makes working with images and videos pretty easy. Convolutional Neural Networks capture useful information from images which helps to correctly classify them.
This project will give you a brief idea about CNN and related concepts. It also builds a CNN model for image classification and the model will also be tested for real-time prediction. If you haven’t already visited, here is the previous project of the series Build Deep Autoencoders Model for Anomaly Detection in Python .
Aim
- To understand the basic ideas related to CNN
- To develop a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify images into different classes
- To deploy the model using Flask
Why use CNN?
Before CNN came into existence, image classification was a very hectic and time-consuming job as features for images needed to be created and fed to the model. Whereas CNN uses automatic feature extraction using convolution to make a feature map containing useful information of the image which is used by CNN to classify the images.
When to use CNN?
- Image Classification
- Image Segmentation
- Video Analysis
- Object Detection
Prerequisites
- Tensorflow
- Flask
- Deep learning and Activation functions
- Build Deep Autoencoders Model for Anomaly Detection in Python
Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: tensorflow, pandas, matplotlib, keras, flask, pathlib
Data Description
Dataset used in this project are images of driving license, social security, and others categorized into respective categories. The images are of different shapes and sizes which are preprocessed before modeling.
Approach
- Data loading
- Data Preprocessing
- Model building and training
- Data Augmentation
- Deployment
