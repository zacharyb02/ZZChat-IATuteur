## There are 4 modules in this course
Detecting and locating objects is one of the most common uses of deep learning for computer vision. Applications include helping autonomous systems navigate complex environments, locating medical conditions like tumors, and identifying ready-to-harvest crops in agriculture. In the course projects, you will apply detection models to real-world scenarios and train a model to detect various parking signs. Completing this course will give you the skills to train detection models for your application.
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
•	Explain how deep learning networks locate and classify objects in images
•	Retrain popular YOLO deep learning models for your application
•	Use a variety of metrics to evaluate prediction results
•	Visualize results to gain insights into model performance
•	Improve model performance by adjusting important model parameters
•	Analyze labeled images to identify and fix potential shortcomings in your data
For the duration of the course, you will have free access to MATLAB, software used by top employers worldwide. The courses draw on the applications using MATLAB, so you spend less time coding and more time applying deep learning concepts.

## Frequently asked questions
Yes. A free license is available to learners enrolled in the course. You must have a computer capable of running MATLAB. You can view the system requirements here .
To access the course materials, assignments and to earn a Certificate, you will need to purchase the Certificate experience when you enroll in a course.  You can try a Free Trial instead, or apply for Financial Aid. The course may offer 'Full Course, No Certificate' instead. This option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade. This also means that you will not be able to purchase a Certificate experience.
When you enroll in the course, you get access to all of the courses in the Certificate, and you earn a certificate when you complete the work. Your electronic Certificate will be added to your Accomplishments page - from there, you can print your Certificate or add it to your LinkedIn profile.
