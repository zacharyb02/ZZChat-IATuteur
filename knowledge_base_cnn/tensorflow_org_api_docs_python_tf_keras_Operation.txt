```python
tf.keras.Operation(
    dtype=None, name=None
)
```




## Attributes
input Retrieves the input tensor(s) of a symbolic operation.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called. output Retrieves the output tensor(s) of a layer.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called.


## Methods


### call


```python
call(
    *args, **kwargs
)
```




### compute_output_spec


```python
compute_output_spec(
    *args, **kwargs
)
```




### from_config


```python
@classmethod
from_config(
    config
)
```


Creates a layer from its config.
This method is the reverse of get_config ,
capable of instantiating the same layer from the config
dictionary. It does not handle layer connectivity
(handled by Network), nor weights (handled by set_weights ).
config A Python dictionary, typically the
output of get_config.


### get_config
Returns the config of the object.
An object config is a Python dictionary (serializable)
containing the information needed to re-instantiate it.


### quantized_call


```python
quantized_call(
    *args, **kwargs
)
```




### symbolic_call


```python
symbolic_call(
    *args, **kwargs
)
```




### __call__


```python
__call__(
    *args, **kwargs
)
```
