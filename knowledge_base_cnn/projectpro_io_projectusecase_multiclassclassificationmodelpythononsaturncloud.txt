# Build a Multi-Class Classification Model in Python on Saturn Cloud
In this machine learning classification project, you will build a multi-class classification model in Python on Saturn Cloud to predict the license status of a business.
## Project Outcomes
- What is Saturn cloud?
- How to create a profile in Saturn cloud.
- How to upload existing notebooks or create your notebooks directly.
- Understanding the business problem.
- Understanding what is multiclass classification.
- Data cleaning and missing data handling if required, using appropriate methods.
- Using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn for data interpretation and advanced visualizations.
- How to perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- How to identify outliers in the dataset using IQR and Z-score method
- Splitting Dataset into Train and Test using various sampling techniques
- Training a model using classification techniques like Logistics Regression, KNN, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree
- Making predictions using the trained model on the test data.
- Gaining confidence in the model using metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, confusion matrix
- What features are most helpful for predictive power using Feature Importance.

## Project Description
## Business Objective
The Jupyter Notebook is a potent tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects. The easiest way for anyone to get started with Jupyter Notebooks is by installing Anaconda. Anaconda is the most widely used Python distribution for data science and comes pre-loaded with all the most popular libraries and tools.
Just like Anaconda, Saturn Cloud is another computing environment. Saturn Cloud is a data science platform that helps people quickly do work using whatever technology they need, including high-memory computing, GPU processors, and Dask clusters. You can use Saturn Cloud with Python, R, or nearly any other programming language.
In this project, we will be creating a Jupyter Server on the Saturn cloud platform for executing our Multiclass label classification project .
### Data Description
We are dealing with a licenses dataset that holds various information related to the business license. This dataset consists of around 86k rows and 32 columns. Some of the essential categories are a timeline of the application, type of business, location details of the business, and payment details. Here, the dependent variable is license status that has five classes.
### Aim
The objective of our problem is to predict the license status for the given business.
### Tech stack
- Language - Python
- Libraries - NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
- Platform - Saturn Cloud
