By the end of this course, learners will be able to configure a Python environment, preprocess and encode data, build Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures, generate predictions, and address imbalanced datasets using resampling techniques. Participants will gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow, Keras, and Anaconda while mastering practical skills in data preparation, model construction, and performance optimization.
This course benefits students, data enthusiasts, and professionals seeking to strengthen their deep learning expertise with a focused, project-based approach. Unlike generic tutorials, it emphasizes a complete end-to-end workflow—from environment setup and data preprocessing to ANN design and evaluation—ensuring learners can independently create predictive models.
What makes this course unique is its balance between conceptual clarity and real-world implementation. Learners not only understand the theory but also apply it directly to customer churn analysis, a practical business use case. With step-by-step lessons, quizzes, and guided projects, this course equips participants with the confidence to implement ANN models in real scenarios and transition smoothly into more advanced deep learning topics.
This module introduces learners to the fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Python. It guides them through environment setup, library installation, data preprocessing, and encoding techniques. By the end, learners will understand how to prepare raw data for neural network training using industry-standard practices.

## Frequently asked questions
To access the course materials, assignments and to earn a Certificate, you will need to purchase the Certificate experience when you enroll in a course.  You can try a Free Trial instead, or apply for Financial Aid. The course may offer 'Full Course, No Certificate' instead. This option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade. This also means that you will not be able to purchase a Certificate experience.
When you enroll in the course, you get access to all of the courses in the Specialization, and you earn a certificate when you complete the work. Your electronic Certificate will be added to your Accomplishments page - from there, you can print your Certificate or add it to your LinkedIn profile.
Yes. In select learning programs, you can apply for financial aid or a scholarship if you can’t afford the enrollment fee. If fin aid or scholarship is available for your learning program selection, you’ll find a link to apply on the description page.
