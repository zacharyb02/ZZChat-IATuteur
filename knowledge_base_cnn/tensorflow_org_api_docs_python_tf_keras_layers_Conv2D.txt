tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(
    filters,
    kernel_size,
    strides=(1, 1),
    padding='valid',
    data_format=None,
    dilation_rate=(1, 1),
    groups=1,
    activation=None,
    use_bias=True,
    kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform',

)
```




### Used in the notebooks
- Use TF1.x models in TF2 workflows
- Better performance with tf.function
- Pruning for on-device inference w/ XNNPACK
- pix2pix: Image-to-image translation with a conditional GAN
This layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved with the layer
input over a single spatial (or temporal) dimension to produce a tensor of
outputs. If use_bias is True, a bias vector is created and added to the
outputs. Finally, if activation is not None , it is applied to the
outputs as well.


## Args
filters int, the dimension of the output space (the number of filters
in the convolution). kernel_size int or tuple/list of 2 integer, specifying the size of the
convolution window. strides int or tuple/list of 2 integer, specifying the stride length
of the convolution. strides > 1 is incompatible with dilation_rate > 1 . padding string, either "valid" or "same" (case-insensitive). "valid" means no padding. "same" results in padding evenly to
the left/right or up/down of the input. When padding="same" and strides=1 , the output has the same size as the input. data_format string, either "channels_last" or "channels_first" .
The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. "channels_last" corresponds to inputs with shape (batch_size, height, width, channels) while "channels_first" corresponds to inputs with shape (batch_size, channels, height, width) . It defaults to the image_data_format value found in your Keras config file at ~/.keras/keras.json . If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last" . dilation_rate int or tuple/list of 2 integers, specifying the dilation
rate to use for dilated convolution. groups A positive int specifying the number of groups in which the
input is split along the channel axis. Each group is convolved
separately with filters // groups filters. The output is the
concatenation of all the groups results along the channel axis.
Input channels and filters must both be divisible by groups . activation Activation function. If None , no activation is applied. use_bias bool, if True , bias will be added to the output. kernel_initializer Initializer for the convolution kernel. If None ,
the default initializer ( "glorot_uniform" ) will be used. bias_initializer Initializer for the bias vector. If None , the
default initializer ( "zeros" ) will be used. kernel_regularizer Optional regularizer for the convolution kernel. bias_regularizer Optional regularizer for the bias vector. activity_regularizer Optional regularizer function for the output. kernel_constraint Optional projection function to be applied to the
kernel after being updated by an Optimizer (e.g. used to implement
norm constraints or value constraints for layer weights). The
function must take as input the unprojected variable and must return
the projected variable (which must have the same shape). Constraints
are not safe to use when doing asynchronous distributed training. bias_constraint Optional projection function to be applied to the
bias after being updated by an Optimizer .
- If data_format="channels_last" :
A 4D tensor with shape: (batch_size, height, width, channels)
- If data_format="channels_first" :
A 4D tensor with shape: (batch_size, channels, height, width)
- If data_format="channels_last" :
A 4D tensor with shape: (batch_size, new_height, new_width, filters)
- If data_format="channels_first" :
A 4D tensor with shape: (batch_size, filters, new_height, new_width)
Returns A 4D tensor representing activation(conv2d(inputs, kernel) + bias) .


## Returns


## Raises
ValueError when both strides > 1 and dilation_rate > 1 .


```python
x = np.random.rand(4, 10, 10, 128)
y = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(x)
print(y.shape)
(4, 8, 8, 32)
```




## Attributes
input Retrieves the input tensor(s) of a symbolic operation.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called. kernel
output Retrieves the output tensor(s) of a layer.
Only returns the tensor(s) corresponding to the first time the operation was called.


## Methods


### convolution_op


```python
convolution_op(
    inputs, kernel
)
```




### enable_lora


```python
enable_lora(
    rank, a_initializer='he_uniform', b_initializer='zeros'
)
```




### from_config


```python
@classmethod
from_config(
    config
)
```


Creates a layer from its config.
This method is the reverse of get_config ,
capable of instantiating the same layer from the config
dictionary. It does not handle layer connectivity
(handled by Network), nor weights (handled by set_weights ).
config A Python dictionary, typically the
output of get_config.


### symbolic_call


```python
symbolic_call(
    *args, **kwargs
)
```
