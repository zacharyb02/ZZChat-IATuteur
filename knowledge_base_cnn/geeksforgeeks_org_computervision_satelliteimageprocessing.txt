# Satellite Image Processing
- Spatial resolution - It is determined by the sensors Instantaneous Field of View(IFoV) and is defined as the pixel size of an image that is visible to the human eye being measured on the ground. Since it has high resolving power or the ability to separate and hence is termed as Spatial Resolution.
- Spectral resolution - This resolution measures the wavelength internal size and determines the number of wavelength intervals that the sensor measures.
- Temporal resolution - The word temporal is associated with time or days and is defined as the time that passes between various imagery cloud periods.
- Radiometric resolution - This resolution provides the actual characteristics of the image and is generally expressed in bits size. It gives the effective bit depth and records the various levels of brightness of imaging system.
