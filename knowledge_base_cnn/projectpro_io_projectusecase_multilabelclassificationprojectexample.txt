# Multilabel Classification Project for Predicting Shipment Modes
Multilabel Classification Project to build a machine learning model that predicts the appropriate mode of transport for each shipment, using a transport dataset with 2000 unique products. The project explores and compares four different approaches to multilabel classification, including naive independent models, classifier chains, natively multilabel models, and multilabel to multiclass approaches.
## Multilabel ClassificationProject Outcomes

## What is Multilabel Classification?
Multilabel classification is a type of machine learning task where each data point can be assigned multiple labels rather than just one. Unlike traditional classification problems, where a model predicts a single category for each input, multilabel classification acknowledges that real-world decisions often involve multiple simultaneous outcomes.
In the context of the transport industry, consider a logistics company trying to determine the best mode of transport for a shipment. In some cases, more than one transport mode may be applicable for a single shipment. For example, a product might be shipped first by truck to a nearby port, then by sea to another country, and finally by rail to the final destination. This shipment would involve multiple labels: truck, sea, and rail.
A multilabel classification model can learn to consider various factors, such as the type of product, weight, distance, destination, and urgency, to predict all suitable transport modes for each shipment. This enables businesses to plan hybrid logistics strategies, optimize routes, and reduce costs while ensuring on-time and safe delivery.
## Multilabel classification Models
This project discusses the following four different approaches to multilabel classification:
- Naive independent models - We will build independent models for each label and combine the predictions to determine the appropriate mode of transport.
- Classifier chains - We will use a chain of classifiers, where the output of one classifier is fed into the next classifier to predict the labels.
- Natively multilabel models - We will use models designed to handle multilabel classification tasks, such as Extra Trees and Neural Networks.
- Multilabel to multiclass approach - We will convert the multilabel problem into a multiclass problem by combining different combinations of labels and training the model to predict these combinations. After prediction, we will separate the combinations back into individual labels.
This project will use all the above mutlilabel classification models to accurately predict suitable transport modes for products based on their physical, storage, and risk characteristics.
## Overview of Multilabel Classification Project with Source Code
This multilable classification example aims to develop a machine-learning model that can predict the appropriate mode of transport for each shipment. You will explore and compare different approaches to multilabel classification for this task.
Data Description
The transport dataset contains 2000 unique products with the following columns:
- Product_Id: Unique identifier for each product.
- Net_Weight: The weight of the product.
- Size: The size of the product, with options A, B, C, D, and E.
- Value: The value of the product.
- Storage: Binary value indicating whether the product requires special storage conditions.
- Packaging_Cost: The cost of packaging the product.
- Expiry_Period: The expiry period of the product.
- Length: The length of the product.
- Height: The height of the product.
- Width: The width of the product.
- Volume: The volume of the product.
- Perishable_Index: Value indicating the perishability of the product.
- Flammability_Index: Value indicating the flammability of the product.
- F145, F7987, F992: anonymous numerical columns.
- Air, Road, Rail, Sea: Binary values indicate the appropriate transport mode for the product.
Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries:  pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow, Google BigQuery.
