## Project Description
## Business Objective
Image classification - Image classification refers to a process in computer vision that can classify an image according to its visual content. Image classification applications include recognizing various objects, such as vehicles, people, moving objects, etc., on the road to enable autonomous driving.
Transfer Learning - The reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem is known as transfer learning in machine learning. A machine uses the knowledge learned from a prior assignment to increase prediction about a new task in transfer learning.
In this project, we will be dealing with a binary classification dataset . A model is to be built that can correctly classify a t-shirt image into plain or topographic. We will be building transfer learning models like InceptionV3 and Resnet.
### Data Description
We have a dataset of t-shirt images categorized into 2 types, namely plain(solid) and topography (contains text)
The training, testing and validation folders contain two subfolders (plain and topography) each.
- Training - around 600 images
- Testing - around 100 images
- Validation - around 150 images
### Aim
To build a transfer learning model that can perform binary classification on the given dataset of images.
### Tech stack
- Language - Python
- Libraries - pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow
### Approach
- Importing the required libraries.
- Load and read the data images
- Data Visualization
- Model Training
- Create a function for initiating Inception and Resnet models Create a function that defines the optimizers Add layers to the pretrained model Function to compile the model Fit and train the model Plot the results Save the model (.h5 file)
