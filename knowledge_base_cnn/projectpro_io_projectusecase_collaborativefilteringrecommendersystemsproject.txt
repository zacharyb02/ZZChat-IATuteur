## Project Description
Business Objective
We often ask our friends with the same tastes to recommend products to use, movies to watch, and whatnot. We trust the recommendations of friends whose taste is similar to ours. Collaborative filtering does the same job. Collaborative filtering is primarily focused on finding similarities between users and mutually encouraging user preferences. Collaborative filtering is the predictive process behind the recommendation engine. The recommendation engine analyzes information about users with similar tastes and assesses the target person's likelihood of enjoying something. Collaborative filtering uses various algorithms to filter data from user reviews and provide personalized recommendations to users with similar settings. Collaborative filtering uses interactions and data collected from other users to filter information.
As a part of a series of Recommender system projects, this project covers Recommendations using a wide variety of Collaborative Filtering algorithms in Python. If you haven’t already visited, here is the previous project of the series Recommender System Machine Learning Project for Beginners-3
