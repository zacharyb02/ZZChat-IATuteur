## There are 2 modules in this course
By the end of this course, learners will be able to identify the foundations of deep learning, analyze stock price datasets, apply preprocessing and feature scaling techniques, develop an RNN with LSTM layers, and evaluate predictions using real-world financial data.
This hands-on course takes learners through the complete journey of building a stock price forecasting model with Python. Starting with environment setup and dataset exploration, participants will learn how to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis, and apply transformations that prepare inputs for deep learning models. The course then dives into constructing and training a Recurrent Neural Network, leveraging LSTM layers to capture sequential dependencies in stock prices. Learners will test predictions on unseen data and visualize results to interpret model accuracy.
What makes this course unique is its practical project-based approach—instead of abstract theory, every step is tied to real-world stock price data from Apple. Whether you are a data science beginner or looking to specialize in time-series forecasting, this course equips you with skills to confidently apply deep learning models to financial predictions and beyond.
This module introduces learners to the foundational concepts and practical setup required for building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for stock price prediction. Learners will explore dataset preparation, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and feature scaling techniques to create a strong data pipeline essential for deep learning models.

## Frequently asked questions
To access the course materials, assignments and to earn a Certificate, you will need to purchase the Certificate experience when you enroll in a course.  You can try a Free Trial instead, or apply for Financial Aid. The course may offer 'Full Course, No Certificate' instead. This option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade. This also means that you will not be able to purchase a Certificate experience.
When you enroll in the course, you get access to all of the courses in the Specialization, and you earn a certificate when you complete the work. Your electronic Certificate will be added to your Accomplishments page - from there, you can print your Certificate or add it to your LinkedIn profile.
Yes. In select learning programs, you can apply for financial aid or a scholarship if you can’t afford the enrollment fee. If fin aid or scholarship is available for your learning program selection, you’ll find a link to apply on the description page.
