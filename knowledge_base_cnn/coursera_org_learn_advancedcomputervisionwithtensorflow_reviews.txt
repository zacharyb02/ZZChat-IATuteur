Excellent course.
This is the course that I was the more eager to take in the specialization as I have created Computer Vision models previously (and added that functionality to my iOS app) last year.
Things I specially liked:
- The week on Segmentation and particularly the assignment as I will be able to do similar implementation with other models like U-Net
- I like the weekly quiz to solidify the new knowledge.
Things I liked less:
- The assignment of Week 2 on Object Detection as it required too much getting in the customization of a specific model. That being said, the exercice is probably useful and training from only 5 images is cool...

The concepts and the teaching is ok. The labs are basically a follow the code, with no great code challenge

A bit hard to mess around with file uploads, but the biggest problem was that Colab blocked GPU access for many hours - maybe I tried to many times...

I thought this was the best course in the tensorflow series so far! You get to learn about more sophisticated architectures like FCN, U-Net, ResNet, etc. The programming exercises take a little more time than the other courses and are intended to help you load models and restore checkpoints from new models you find on blogs. It would be great to also have classes on NLP and reinforcement learning at this level.

I have learnt many useful computer vision algorithms and more importantly applied them myself. In my mind, practical sessions provided during the course makes it one of the best in Coursera platform

This course is amazing. It is introduced the most important topics in Computer Vision nowadays: from object detection to generative networks. This is a must-to-do in any capacitation on AI field.

The level of preparation of the instructors showed. Salient points were brought to the forefront. A lot of rich material, will probably take me a year to fully assimilate.

This is by far the richest course I have ever taken on Coursera amongst the 19 courses I already finished during the past two years. It is well structured and provided with neat introductions for each of the taught topics. Moreover, the labs and exercises help a lot in getting your hands dirty with coding, especially if try to write the code yourself from your memory after going through it. Finally, the supporting team is highly cooperative and responsive to issues raised by the learning in the Discourse Forum. Thank you Laurance.

every thing was good, they stop maintaining Tensorflow's object detection API and In this course they are still teaching it. they just showed how to load  model and customize it, but they did not show how to save/export the trained model. It is difficult find online sources where they are showing saving the trained custom model.

Deep-dive into various kind of convolutional neural networks and great extension to my current knowledge.
In my opinion course and its assignments are significantly more difficult and less self-explanatory than previously in specialization. Can't decide if it's better or worse.

Excellent course structure and well defined explanations. Assignments were fun as always. I learnt a lot about computer vision and managed to get useful functions for visualisations especially in object detections. Thank you to the teacher!!

The course gives an advanced guidance encouraging the learner to go the extra step to understand the coding and implementation of different deep learning algorithms. Lab modules each week were very insightful. Thank you for the course

Thank you Coursera for this wonderful course . It was only at this course I came to know that we can visualize what our neural network was paying attention to. Each and every lectures were amazing and I learned a lot

Excellent content and great presentation.
I am doing a masters using computer vision for medical diagnostics and this course provided excellent clear summaries of some of the basics on which my thesis is based.

Excellent course !
The weekly assignments are also quite through and challenging.
(Thankfully, the ungraded labs are quite helpful for solving the assignments).
