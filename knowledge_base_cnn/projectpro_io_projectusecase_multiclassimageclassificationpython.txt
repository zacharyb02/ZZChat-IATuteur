## Project Description
Business Objective
Image classification helps to classify a given set of images as their respective category classes. There are many applications of image classification today, one of them being self-driving cars. An image classification model can be built that recognizes various objects, such as vehicles, people, moving objects, etc., on the road to enable autonomous driving.
There are three main classes of input images in this project, and we need to build a model that can correctly identify a given image. To achieve this, we will be using one of the famous machine learning algorithms used for image classification, i.e., Convolutional Neural Network (or CNN).
Data Description
We will be using a dataset of images categorized into three types, namely the driving license, social security, and others.
The training and testing data each contains these three subfolders. There are around 50 images in each subfolder of testing data, while approximately 200 images in each subfolder of training data.
Aim
To build a sequential model that can perform multiclass classification on a given set of data images.
Tech stack
- Language - Python
- Libraries - numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, cv2
Approach
