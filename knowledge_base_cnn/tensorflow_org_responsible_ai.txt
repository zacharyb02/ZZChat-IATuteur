# Learn how to integrate Responsible AI practices into your ML workflow using TensorFlow
TensorFlow is committed to helping make progress in the responsible development of AI by sharing a collection of resources and tools with the ML community.


## What is Responsible AI?
The development of AI is creating new opportunities to solve challenging, real-world problems. It is also raising new questions about the best way to build AI systems that benefit everyone.
Designing AI systems should follow software development best practices while taking a human-centered approach to ML
As the impact of AI increases across sectors and societies, it is critical to work towards systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone
Understanding and trusting AI systems is important to ensuring they are working as intended
Training models off of sensitive data needs privacy preserving safeguards
Identifying potential threats can help keep AI systems safe and secure


## Responsible AI in your ML workflow
Responsible AI practices can be incorporated at every step of the ML workflow. Here are some key questions to consider at each stage.


### Who is my ML system for?
The way actual users experience your system is essential to assessing
the true impact of its predictions, recommendations, and decisions. Make
sure to get input from a diverse set of users early on in your
development process.


### Am I using a representative dataset?
Is your data sampled in a way that represents your users (e.g. will be
used for all ages, but you only have training data from senior citizens)
and the real-world setting (e.g. will be used year-round, but you only
have training data from the summer)?


### Is there real-world/human bias in my data?
Underlying biases in data can contribute to complex feedback loops that
reinforce existing stereotypes.


### What methods should I use to train my model?
Use training methods that build fairness, interpretability, privacy, and
security into the model.


### How is my model performing?
Evaluate user experience in real-world scenarios across a broad spectrum
of users, use cases, and contexts of use. Test and iterate in dogfood
first, followed by continued testing after launch.


### Are there complex feedback loops?
Even if everything in the overall system design is carefully crafted,
ML-based models rarely operate with 100% perfection when applied to
real, live data. When an issue occurs in a live product, consider
whether it aligns with any existing societal disadvantages, and how it
will be impacted by both short- and long-term solutions.
