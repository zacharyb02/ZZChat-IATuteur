## There are 4 modules in this course
Visual inspection and medical imaging are two applications that aim to find anything unusual in images. In this course, you’ll train and calibrate specialized models known as anomaly detectors to identify defects. You’ll also use advanced techniques to overcome common data challenges with deep learning. AI-assisted labeling is a technique to auto-label images, saving time and money when you have tens of thousands of images. If you have too few images, you’ll generate synthetic training images using data augmentation for situations where acquiring more data is expensive or impossible.
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
•	Train anomaly detection models
•	Generate synthetic training images using data augmentation
•	Use AI-assisted annotation to label images and video files
•	Import models from 3rd party tools like PyTorch
•	Describe approaches to using your model outside of MATLAB
For the duration of the course, you will have free access to MATLAB, software used by top employers worldwide. The courses draw on the applications using MATLAB, so you spend less time coding and more time applying deep learning concepts.
Train anomaly detection models. These models do not find specific objects or classes, but instead find unusual regions in images.

## Frequently asked questions
Yes. A free license is available to learners enrolled in the course. You must have a computer capable of running MATLAB. You can view the system requirements here .
To access the course materials, assignments and to earn a Certificate, you will need to purchase the Certificate experience when you enroll in a course.  You can try a Free Trial instead, or apply for Financial Aid. The course may offer 'Full Course, No Certificate' instead. This option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade. This also means that you will not be able to purchase a Certificate experience.
When you enroll in the course, you get access to all of the courses in the Certificate, and you earn a certificate when you complete the work. Your electronic Certificate will be added to your Accomplishments page - from there, you can print your Certificate or add it to your LinkedIn profile.
