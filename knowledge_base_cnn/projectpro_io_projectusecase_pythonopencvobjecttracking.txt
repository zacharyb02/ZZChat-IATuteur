## Project Description
Business Objective
Object tracking is the task of automatically identifying objects in a video and interpreting them as a set of trajectories with high accuracy. Object tracking is an application of deep learning. It takes an initial set of object detections, creates a unique ID for each of the initial detections, and then tracks each object as they move around frames in a video, maintaining the ID assignment.
Object tracking can be done on two levels, Single Object Tracking (SOT) and Multiple Object Tracking (MOT). In single object tracking, only a single object is tracked even if the environment has multiple objects in it. The object to be tracked is determined by the initialization in the first frame. Whereas in multiple object tracking, all the objects present in the environment are tracked over time. If a detection-based tracker is used, it can also track new objects that emerge in the middle of the video.
Data Description
In this particular project, we will use various video clips to perform object tracking.
Aim
To perform single object tracking (SOT) and multiple object tracking (MOT) on a given input video using various algorithms.
