## Project Description
Overview
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service ( IaaS ), platform as a service ( PaaS ), and packaged software as a service ( SaaS ) offerings. AWS services can offer organizations tools such as compute power, database storage, and content delivery services. One of the important services of AWS is Amazon sagemaker. Amazon sagemaker is a managed service on AWS cloud. It provides tools to deploy any Machine Learning algorithm on the cloud for predictive analysis. Data Scientist needs to deploy their built Machine Learning model in real-time, but they lack software engineering skills and rely on software engineers to deploy their model.
In this project, a classification model predicting the cause of death has been built on AWS using the service amazon sagemaker. AWS services like sagemaker, datawrangler, and lambda have been used in this project.
Aim
- To understand the working of AWS
- To build a classification model predicting a patient’s cause of death
Data Description
The data provided is for 2020 death cases. There are 16 features available with case
number as a unique identifier and Reason of Death as a target variable. The Data
dictionary is attached with the data.
Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pytorch, pandas, numpy, regex,boto3, seaborn, sagemaker, matplotlib
- Services used- AWS lambda, AWS sagemaker, Datawrangler
