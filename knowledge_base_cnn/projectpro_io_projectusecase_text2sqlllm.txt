## Project Description
Most organizations across industries these days rely heavily on data and store in relational databases, which require SQL (Structured Query Language) to retrieve and manipulate information. However, writing SQL queries can be challenging for many professionals, especially those without a technical background, such as business analysts, product managers, or executives. Despite the widespread availability of data, a significant bottleneck remains: the need for SQL expertise to extract meaningful insights. This creates a dependency on specialized teams, such as data analysts or engineers, to write queries and generate reports. As a result, decision-making can be delayed, and productivity hampered, particularly in situations where quick access to data is critical. This gap between data availability and data accessibility highlights the need for solutions that allow everyone to query databases without specialized skills. That’s exactly where building a Text-to-SQL agent comes in.
## Why use LLM for SQL-Query Generation?
Building a Text-to-SQL application using Large Language Models (LLMs) addresses two critical challenges at once: making data more accessible to everyone and dramatically improving productivity. By breaking down the barriers of traditional query writing, these systems allow users to interact with data through simple, natural language, while harnessing the advanced reasoning of LLMs to generate accurate and efficient SQL on the fly.
To understand the impact of this approach, one must look at two key questions:
### 1. Why is a Text-to-SQL Model Necessary?
The need for democratizing data access is more pressing than ever. A Text-to-SQL tool bridges this gap by enabling non-technical users to interact with databases using natural language. This reduces the reliance on SQL experts, accelerates decision-making, and promotes a more data-driven culture within organizations.
Moreover, even for experienced coders, writing complex SQL queries can be time-consuming. A tool that can accurately translate natural language into optimized SQL queries can significantly enhance productivity, allowing coders to focus on more strategic tasks rather than spending time on routine query writing.
### 2.How LLMs Are Solving Productivity Problems?
LLMs like GPT-4 have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. When applied to the task of translating natural language to SQL, LLMs can accurately interpret user intentions, generate complex SQL queries, and even optimize them for performance. This reduces the likelihood of errors, enhances query accuracy, and enables faster data retrieval.
LLMs also contribute to productivity by automating routine tasks, reducing the time spent on query formulation, and enabling even non-technical users to retrieve data independently. This empowers a broader range of professionals to engage with data directly, fostering a more agile and responsive organization.
## Text to SQL LLM Project Overview
The aim of the Text-2-SQL LangChain project is to develop a Streamlit-based web application that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries into optimized SQL commands, enabling secure database interaction, user authentication, and seamless deployment on AWS.
Prerequisite Project: Kindly ensure the completion of the LLM Project for building and fine-tuning a large language model before proceeding with this project.
Prerequisites: Basics of LLMs, Prompt Engineering, Python and Streamlit
Note: Utilizing Azure and AWS services for this project may result in charges; it is essential to thoroughly review the Azure and AWS documentation to understand the pricing structure and potential costs associated with different resources and usage patterns.
Data Description
The food delivery application database contains detailed records of users, restaurants, menu items, orders, payments, and reviews, capturing every transaction and interaction within the app. This comprehensive dataset, with tables such as Users, Restaurants, Orders, and Reviews, is designed to support the analysis of customer behaviors, service optimization, and overall business performance.
Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3.10
- Libraries: Langchain, Langchain-openai, streamlit, Databricks
- Model: GPT-4

1. Virtual Environment and Dependencies
- Create a Python virtual environment and install necessary libraries (Streamlit, OpenAI, LangChain, database connectors).
- Configure access to Databricks and Snowflake, including connection setup and testing.
- Set up the development environment in VS Code.
2. LLM Integration and Database Interaction
- Integrate the LLM via API to convert natural language queries into SQL.
- Develop backend modules to execute SQL queries on Databricks/Snowflake and retrieve results.
- Implement error handling to manage SQL generation and execution issues.
3. Prompt Engineering and SQL Optimization
- Create and refine prompt templates to accurately generate SQL, including complex queries (CTEs, joins).
- Implement SQL validation and optimization to ensure generated queries are efficient and correct.
4. User Interface and Authentication
- Build an intuitive Streamlit interface for inputting queries, displaying SQL results, and managing query history/favorites.
- Implement user authentication with secure session management and personalized experiences.
5. Advanced Query Handling and Feature Integration
- Develop "Quick Analysis," "Deep Dive Analysis," and "Favorites" sections for enhanced user interaction.
- Test the application with complex SQL queries to ensure robustness.
- Configure and deploy the application on AWS EC2 with HTTPS for secure access and scalable performance.
