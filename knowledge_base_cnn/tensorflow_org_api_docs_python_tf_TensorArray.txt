### Used in the notebooks
- Better performance with tf.function
- Playing CartPole with the Actor-Critic method
- Modeling COVID-19 spread in Europe and the effect of interventions
- Neural machine translation with attention
- Neural machine translation with a Transformer and Keras
This class is meant to be used with dynamic iteration primitives such as while_loop and map_fn .  It supports gradient back-propagation via special
"flow" control flow dependencies.
Note that although the array can be read multiple times and positions can be
overwritten, behavior may be undefined when storing multiple references to
the same array and clear_after_read is False. In particular, avoid using
methods like concat() to convert an intermediate TensorArray to a Tensor,
then further modifying the TensorArray, particularly if you need to backprop
through it later.
Example 1: Plain reading and writing.


```python
ta = tf.TensorArray(tf.float32, size=0, dynamic_size=True, clear_after_read=False)
ta = ta.write(0, 10)
ta = ta.write(1, 20)
ta = ta.write(2, 30)
ta.read(0)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=10.0>
ta.read(1)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=20.0>
ta.read(2)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=30.0>
ta.stack()
<tf.Tensor: shape=(3,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([10., 20., 30.],
dtype=float32)>
```


Example 2: Fibonacci sequence algorithm that writes in a loop then returns.


```python
@tf.function
def fibonacci(n):
  ta = tf.TensorArray(tf.float32, size=0, dynamic_size=True)
  ta = ta.unstack([0., 1.])
  for i in range(2, n):
    ta = ta.write(i, ta.read(i - 1) + ta.read(i - 2))
  return ta.stack()
fibonacci(7)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(7,), dtype=float32,
numpy=array([0., 1., 1., 2., 3., 5., 8.], dtype=float32)>
```


Example 3: A simple loop interacting with a tf.Variable .


```python
v = tf.Variable(1)
@tf.function
def f(x):
  ta = tf.TensorArray(tf.int32, size=0, dynamic_size=True)
  for i in tf.range(x):
    v.assign_add(i)
    ta = ta.write(i, v)
  return ta.stack()
f(5)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(5,), dtype=int32, numpy=array([ 1,  2,  4,  7, 11],
dtype=int32)>
```




## Args
dtype (required) data type of the TensorArray. size (optional) int32 scalar Tensor : the size of the TensorArray.
Required if handle is not provided. dynamic_size (optional) Python bool: If true, writes to the TensorArray
can grow the TensorArray past its initial size.  Default: False. clear_after_read Boolean (optional, default: True).  If True, clear
TensorArray values after reading them.  This disables read-many
semantics, but allows early release of memory. tensor_array_name (optional) Python string: the name of the TensorArray.
This is used when creating the TensorArray handle.  If this value is
set, handle should be None. handle (optional) A Tensor handle to an existing TensorArray.  If this
is set, tensor_array_name should be None. Only supported in graph mode. flow (optional) A float Tensor scalar coming from an existing TensorArray.flow . Only supported in graph mode. infer_shape (optional, default: True) If True, shape inference is
enabled.  In this case, all elements must have the same shape. element_shape (optional, default: None) A TensorShape object specifying
the shape constraints of each of the elements of the TensorArray. Need
not be fully defined. colocate_with_first_write_call If True , the TensorArray will be
colocated on the same device as the Tensor used on its first write
(write operations include write , unstack , and split ).  If False ,
the TensorArray will be placed on the device determined by the device
context available during its initialization. name A name for the operation (optional).


## Raises
ValueError if both handle and tensor_array_name are provided. TypeError if handle is provided but is not a Tensor.


## Attributes
dtype The data type of this TensorArray. dynamic_size Python bool; if True the TensorArray can grow dynamically. element_shape The tf.TensorShape of elements in this TensorArray. flow The flow Tensor forcing ops leading to this TensorArray state. handle The reference to the TensorArray.
