```python

    func=None, inp=None, Tout=None, stateful=True, name=None
)
```




### Used in the notebooks
- Playing CartPole with the Actor-Critic method
Given a python function func wrap this function as an operation in a tf.function . func must take numpy arrays as its arguments and
return numpy arrays as its outputs.
There are two ways to use tf.numpy_function .


### As a decorator
When using tf.numpy_function as a decorator:


```python
@tf.numpy_function(Tout=tf.float32)
def my_numpy_func(x):
  # x will be a numpy array with the contents of the input to the
  # tf.function
  print(f'executing eagerly, {x=}')
  return np.sinh(x)
```




```python
my_numpy_func(1.0).numpy()
executing eagerly, x=1.0
1.17520
```


The behavior doesn't change inside a tf.function :


```python
@tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(None, tf.float32)])
def tf_function(input):
  y = tf.numpy_function(my_numpy_func, [input], tf.float32)
  return y
tf_function(tf.constant(1.)).numpy()
executing eagerly, x=array(1.)
1.17520
```




### Inplace
This form can be useful if you don't control the function's source,
but it is harder to read.
Here is the same function with no decorator:


```python
def my_func(x):
  # x will be a numpy array with the contents of the input to the
  # tf.function
  print(f'executing eagerly, {x=}')
  return np.sinh(x)
```


To run tf.numpy_function in-place, pass the function, its inputs, and the
output type in a single call to tf.numpy_function :


```python
tf.numpy_function(my_func, [tf.constant(1.0)], tf.float32)
executing eagerly, x=array(1.)
1.17520
```




### More info
Comparison to tf.py_function : tf.py_function and tf.numpy_function are very similar, except that tf.numpy_function takes numpy arrays, and not tf.Tensor s. If you want the
function to contain tf.Tensors , and have any TensorFlow operations executed
in the function be differentiable, please use tf.py_function .
- Calling tf.numpy_function will acquire the Python Global Interpreter Lock
(GIL) that allows only one thread to run at any point in time. This will
preclude efficient parallelization and distribution of the execution of the
program. Therefore, you are discouraged to use tf.numpy_function outside
of prototyping and experimentation.
- The body of the function (i.e. func ) will not be serialized in a tf.SavedModel . Therefore, you should not use this function if you need to
serialize your model and restore it in a different environment.
- The operation must run in the same address space as the Python program
that calls tf.numpy_function() . If you are using distributed
TensorFlow, you must run a tf.distribute.Server in the same process as the
program that calls tf.numpy_function you must pin the created
operation to a device in that server (e.g. using with tf.device(): ).
- Currently tf.numpy_function is not compatible with XLA. Calling tf.numpy_function inside tf.function(jit_compile=True) will raise an
error.
- Since the function takes numpy arrays, you cannot take gradients
through a numpy_function. If you require something that is differentiable,
please consider using tf.py_function.


## Args
func A Python function, which accepts numpy.ndarray objects as arguments
and returns a list of numpy.ndarray objects (or a single numpy.ndarray ). This function must accept as many arguments as there are
tensors in inp , and these argument types will match the corresponding tf.Tensor objects in inp . The returns numpy.ndarray s must match the
number and types defined Tout . Important Note: Input and output numpy.ndarray s of func are not guaranteed to be copies. In some cases
their underlying memory will be shared with the corresponding TensorFlow
tensors. In-place modification or storing func input or return values in
python datastructures without explicit (np.)copy can have
non-deterministic consequences. inp A list of tf.Tensor objects. Tout A list or tuple of tensorflow data types or a single tensorflow data
type if there is only one, indicating what func returns. stateful (Boolean.) Setting this argument to False tells the runtime to
treat the function as stateless, which enables certain optimizations. A
function is stateless when given the same input it will return the same
output and have no side effects; its only purpose is to have a return
value. The behavior for a stateful function with the stateful argument
False is undefined. In particular, caution should be taken when mutating
the input arguments as this is a stateful operation. name (Optional) A name for the operation.


## Returns
- If func is None this returns a decorator that will ensure the
decorated function will always run with eager execution even if called
from a tf.function / tf.Graph .
- If used func is not None this executes func with eager execution
and returns the result: A single or list of tf.Tensor which func computes.
