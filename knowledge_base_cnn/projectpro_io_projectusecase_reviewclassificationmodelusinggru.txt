## Project Description
## Overview
Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) is an improved version of the standard Recurrent Neural Network(RNNs). As a variant of the recurrent neural network, they are able to process memories of sequential data by storing previous inputs in the internal state of networks and plan from the history of previous inputs.
In this project, an application review classification model has been built using GRU. The project focuses on classifying the review of the application based on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 being negative sentiment and 5 being positive sentiment. If you haven’t visited already, here is the previous project of the series Build CNN Image Classification Models for Real Time Prediction
### Aim
- To understand the Gated Recurrent Unit
- To classify the review of an app on a scale of 1 to 5 using Gated Recurrent Unit
### Data Description
The dataset contains the reviews and the ratings of the app. The dataset has a score column and content column. The score columns have a number range between 1 to 5 based on the content column.
### Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib, sci-kit learn, pillow, gunicorn, textblob, nltk, keras, flask
## Approach
- Data Preprocessing Converting words to lower case Lemmatization of the words Tokenization of the words One hot encoding of the scores
- Converting words to lower case
- Lemmatization of the words
- Tokenization of the words
- One hot encoding of the scores
- Model Training Training sequential model in Tensorflow
### Model Training
- Training sequential model in Tensorflow
- Model Evaluation Evaluation of model on test data
### Model Evaluation
- Evaluation of model on test data
