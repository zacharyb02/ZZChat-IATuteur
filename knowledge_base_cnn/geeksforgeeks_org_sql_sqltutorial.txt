# SQL Tutorial
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases.
- Mainly used to manage data. Whether you want to create, delete, update or  read data, SQL provides commands to perform these operations.
- Widely supported across various database systems like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and many others.
- Mainly works with Relational Databases (data is stored in the form of tables)
## Writing First SQL Query
Before running SQL queries you need to set up a database server like MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite. Here, we are going to use MySQL server. Follow below steps to set up a basic SQL Environment:
- Install MySQL in your system
- Start MySQL Server
- Access MySQL Command Line
After your MySQL environment is set up, you can write your SQL program. Below is the example to display " Hello World" using SQL.
```python
CREATE DATABASE test_db;
```
```python
USE test_db;
```
```python
CREATE TABLE greetings (    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,    message VARCHAR(255));
```
```python
INSERT INTO greetings (message)VALUES ('Hello, World!');
```
```python
SELECT message FROM greetings;
```
Note: Try replacing "Hello World!" with your name in the SQL query. It's a fun way to see how databases store and display your own data! Give it a try and watch your name pop up!
## Why Learn SQL?
SQL's integration with various technologies makes it essential for managing and querying data in databases. Whether it is in traditional relational databases (RDBMS) or modern technologies such as machine learning, AI and blockchain, SQL plays a key role. It works effortlessly  with DBMS to help users interact with data, whether stored in structured RDBMS or other types of databases.
- Data Science & Analytics: Used for querying large datasets, data cleaning and analysis. Analysts use SQL to generate reports and insights that inform business decisions.
- Machine Learning & AI: Helps in preparing and managing the data required for training machine learning models and AI algorithms. It is used for data cleaning, transformation, and extraction.
- Web Development: Used to manage user data, e-commerce transactions, and content management in websites and applications built with frameworks like Django, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.
- Cloud and Big Data: SQL is integrated into cloud-based databases (e.g., Amazon RDS, Microsoft Azure SQL) and Big Data platforms (e.g., Apache Hive) to enable seamless data querying and management.
- Blockchain and Decentralized Systems: In blockchain systems, SQL can be used to manage off-chain data, providing efficient data storage and retrieval alongside decentralized ledger technology
## SQL Basics
Learn the foundational concepts of SQL, essential for anyone working with relational databases. This section covers the syntax, commands, and key elements to start querying and managing data effectively.
- Introduction
- Data Types
- Operators
- Commands
## SQL Database
This section guides you through the process of creating and managing databases. Learn how to create, select, rename, and drop databases with practical examples.
- CREATE Database
- DROP Database
- RENAME Database
- SELECT Database
## SQL Tables
Tables are the core data structures in databases, organizing data into rows and columns. This section covers how to create, modify, and manage tables effectively.
- CREATE TABLE
- DROP TABLE
- RENAME TABLE
- TRUNCATE TABLE
- COPY TABLE
- TEMP TABLE
- ALTER TABLE
## SQL Queries
Master writing SQL queries to interact with and manipulate data stored in your tables. This section covers common query types and operations.
- SELECT Statement
- INSERT INTO
- INSERT Multiple Rows
- UPDATE Statement
- DELETE Statement
- DELETE Duplicate Rows
## SQL Clauses
Unlock powerful ways to filter, organize, and group your query results. Clauses help you refine your data extraction.
- WHERE Clause
- WITH Clause
- HAVING Clause
- ORDER By Clause
- Group By Clause
- LIMIT Clause
- Distinct Clause
- FETCH
- Aliases
## SQL Operators
SQL Operators" refers to the fundamental symbols and keywords within the SQL that enable users to perform various operations. Operators let you build complex query conditions.
- Logical Operators
- LIKE Operator
- IN Operator
- NOT Operator
- NOT EQUAL Operator
- IS NULL Operator
- UNION Operator
- UNION ALL Operator
- EXCEPT Operator
- BETWEEN Operator
- ALL and ANY
- INTERSECT Operator
- EXISTS Operator
- CASE Operator
## SQL Aggregate Functions
Whether you are calculating the total sales revenue for a particular product, finding the average age of customers, or determining the highest value in a dataset, SQL Aggregate Functions make these tasks straightforward and manageable.
- Aggregate Function
- Count() Function
- SUM() Function
- MIN() Function
- MAX() Function
- AVG() Function
## Data Constraints
Constraints act as rules or conditions imposed on the data, dictating what values are permissible and what actions can be taken. They play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and coherence of the database by preventing errors.
- NOT NULL Constraints
- Primary Key Constraints
- Foreign Key Constraints
- Composite Key
- Unique Constraints
- Alternate Key
- CHECK Constraints
- DEFAULT Constraints
## SQL Joins
SQL joins serve as the weaver's tool, allowing you to seamlessly merge data from multiple tables based on common threads. So explore this section to learn how to use JOIN command.
- JOIN
- Outer Join
- Left Join
- Right Join
- Full Join
- Cross Join
- Self Join
- UPDATE with JOIN
- DELETE JOIN
- Recursive Join
## SQL Functions
SQL functions offer an efficient and versatile approach to data analysis. Enhance your queries with built-in functions that manipulate data types and perform calculations.
- Date Functions
- String Functions
- Numeric Functions
- Statistical Functions
- JSON Functions
- Conversion Functions
- Datatype Functions
- LTRIM Function
- UPPER Function
- RTRIM Function
## SQL Views
Views simplify complex queries and improve security by controlling data access. Views also act like a helpful security guard, keeping the most sensitive information in the back room, while still allowing access to what's needed.
- CREATE VIEW
- UPDATE VIEW
- RENAME VIEW
- DROP VIEW
## SQL Indexes
Improve query performance by creating indexes that speed up data retrieval.
- Indexes
- Create Index
- Drop Index
- Show Indexes
- Unique Index
- Clustered Index vs Non-Clustered Index
## SQL Subquery
Perform queries within queries to solve complex data retrieval problems. They help in filtering data or performing operations on data that would otherwise require multiple queries.
- Subquery
- Correlated Subqueries
- Nested Queries
## Miscellaneous Topics
Explore advanced and useful SQL concepts to deepen your knowledge
