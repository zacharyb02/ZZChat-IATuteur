## Source code + Project materials
## Project Description
Overview
Most of the time, we develop and train the machine learning models in our local Python notebook and hand off the resultant code to an app developer, who must then integrate it into an application and deploy it.  Often, the bugs and the performance issue go unnoticed until the code has already been deployed, and it then becomes a cumbersome and frustrating task to resolve the issue. So, to tackle this problem, Azure DevOps came into the picture. You can build Machine learning apps faster through Azure DevOps. The whole process now becomes a part of the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline of the Azure DevOps. You can continue to write and train models in your favorite Python environment and rest assured that it is your Python code that is deployed to production without worrying about any conflicts between the app and the model.
This project is focused on how to build the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines using the model developed in Deep Learning Project for Beginners with Source Code Part 1 with Azure DevOps . Terraform is used alongside Azure UI to automate the creation of Azure resources of the project. Please follow instructions.md file in the terraform code folder to execute Terraform.
Aim
- To understand Azure DevOps
- To build a classification model which will predict the customer’s license status
- To deploy the license status classification model in a scalable way through Azure DevOps
Data Description
The dataset has information about the customers whose license status, i.e., issued, renewed, canceled, is to be predicted.
