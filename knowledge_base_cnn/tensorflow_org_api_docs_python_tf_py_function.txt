```python
tf.py_function(
    func=None, inp=None, Tout=None, name=None
)
```




### Used in the notebooks
- Better performance with the tf.data API
- tf.data: Build TensorFlow input pipelines
- Better performance with tf.function
Using tf.py_function inside a tf.function allows you to run a python
function using eager execution, inside the tf.function 's graph.
This has two main effects:
- This allows you to use nofunc=None, inp=None, Tout=None tensorflow code
inside your tf.function .
- It allows you to run python control logic in a tf.function without
relying on tf.autograph to convert the code to use tensorflow control logic
(tf.cond, tf.while_loop).
Both of these features can be useful for debugging.
Since tf.py_function operates on Tensor s it is still
differentiable (once).
There are two ways to use this function:


### As a decorator
Use tf.py_function as a decorator to ensure the function always runs
eagerly.
When using tf.py_function as a decorator:
For example, you might use tf.py_function to
implement the log huber function.


```python
@tf.py_function(Tout=tf.float32)
def py_log_huber(x, m):
  print('Running with eager execution.')
  if tf.abs(x) <= m:
    return x**2
  else:
    return m**2 * (1 - 2 * tf.math.log(m) + tf.math.log(x**2))
```


Under eager execution the function operates normally:


```python
x = tf.constant(1.0)
m = tf.constant(2.0)
print(py_log_huber(x,m).numpy())
Running with eager execution.
1.0
```


Inside a tf.function the tf.py_function is not converted to a tf.Graph .:


```python
@tf.function
def tf_wrapper(x):
  print('Tracing.')
  m = tf.constant(2.0)
  return py_log_huber(x,m)
```


The tf.py_function only executes eagerly, and only when the tf.function is called:


```python
print(tf_wrapper(x).numpy())
Tracing.
Running with eager execution.
1.0
print(tf_wrapper(x).numpy())
Running with eager execution.
1.0
```




```python
with tf.GradientTape() as t:
  t.watch(x)
  y = tf_wrapper(x)
Running with eager execution.
t.gradient(y, x).numpy()
2.0
```




### Inplace
You can also skip the decorator and use tf.py_function in-place.
This form is a useful shortcut if you don't control the function's source,
but it is harder to read.


```python
# No decorator
def log_huber(x, m):
  if tf.abs(x) <= m:
    return x**2
  else:
    return m**2 * (1 - 2 * tf.math.log(m) + tf.math.log(x**2))
x = tf.constant(1.0)
m = tf.constant(2.0)
tf.py_function(func=log_huber, inp=[x, m], Tout=tf.float32).numpy()
1.0
```




### More info
You can also use tf.py_function to debug your models at runtime
using Python tools, i.e., you can isolate portions of your code that
you want to debug, wrap them in Python functions and insert pdb tracepoints
or print statements as desired, and wrap those functions in tf.py_function .
For more information on eager execution, see the Eager guide .
tf.py_function is similar in spirit to tf.numpy_function , but unlike
the latter, the former lets you use TensorFlow operations in the wrapped
Python function. In particular, while tf.compat.v1.py_func only runs on CPUs
and wraps functions that take NumPy arrays as inputs and return NumPy arrays
as outputs, tf.py_function can be placed on GPUs and wraps functions
that take Tensors as inputs, execute TensorFlow operations in their bodies,
and return Tensors as outputs.
- Calling tf.py_function will acquire the Python Global Interpreter Lock
(GIL) that allows only one thread to run at any point in time. This will
preclude efficient parallelization and distribution of the execution of the
program.
- The body of the function (i.e. func ) will not be serialized in a GraphDef . Therefore, you should not use this function if you need to
serialize your model and restore it in a different environment.
- The operation must run in the same address space as the Python program
that calls tf.py_function() . If you are using distributed
TensorFlow, you must run a tf.distribute.Server in the same process as the
program that calls tf.py_function() and you must pin the created
operation to a device in that server (e.g. using with tf.device(): ).
- Currently tf.py_function is not compatible with XLA. Calling tf.py_function inside tf.function(jit_compile=True) will raise an
error.


## Args
func A Python function that accepts inp as arguments, and returns a value
(or list of values) whose type is described by Tout . Do not set func when using tf.py_function as a decorator. inp Input arguments for func .  A list whose elements are Tensor s or CompositeTensors (such as tf.RaggedTensor ); or a single Tensor or CompositeTensor . Do not set inp when using tf.py_function as a
decorator. Tout The type(s) of the value(s) returned by func .  One of the following.
- If func returns a Tensor (or a value that can be converted to a
Tensor): the tf.DType for that value. * If func returns a CompositeTensor : The tf.TypeSpec for that value. * If func returns None : the empty list ( [] ). * If func returns a list of Tensor and CompositeTensor values: a corresponding list of tf.DType s and tf.TypeSpec s for each value. name A name for the operation (optional).


## Returns
- If func is None this returns a decorator that will ensure the
decorated function will always run with eager execution even if called
from a tf.function / tf.Graph .
- If used func is not None this executes func with eager execution
and returns the result: a Tensor , CompositeTensor , or list of Tensor and CompositeTensor ; or an empty list if func returns None .
