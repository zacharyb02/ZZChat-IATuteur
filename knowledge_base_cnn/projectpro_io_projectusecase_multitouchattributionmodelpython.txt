## Project Description
## Introduction to Multi-Touch Attribution Model In Python Project
Marketing is a technique of getting potential clients or customers interested in one’s products and services. Businesses can reach out to their customers via various marketing channels. It looks simple by definition but is indeed a much more challenging task. Advertisers use various online marketing channels to reach consumers, and they typically want to know how much each channel contributes to their marketing success. This is what is known as multi-channel attribution.
In many cases, advertisers approach this problem using simple marketing attribution models that help them understand the importance of each marketing channel. A few attribution models are as follows:
- Single Touch attribution models like First Touch Conversion, Last Touch Conversion
- Multi-Touch attribution models like Linear Touch Conversion
- Probabilistic models like Markov chains, etc
We will try building all these machine learning models in our project to understand how these models will help us find which channels will lead us to more conversions.
## Project Overview: How to build a multi-touch attribution model in Python?
Here is a brief overview of the marketing attribution model in the python project.
### Aim of the Attribution Modeling using Machine Learning Project
In this project, we aim to improve the advertising ROI by quantifying the actual value of the multi-faceted advertising campaigns. This will enable business stakeholders to make decisions based on the millions of converting click paths by isolating the impact of every touchpoint. The project aims at building multiple attribution models on the given dataset to discover channels leading to greater customer conversions.
### Tech Stack for Implementing Multi-Touch Attribution
Language - Python
Libraries – NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, itertools, gekko, pandas-profiling
### Dataset for Attribution Modeling in Python
The data is in the form of a CSV file with a data size of 586737 rows and six columns.
The columns are as follows:
Cookie - Anonymous customer-id
Time - Date and time when the visit took place
Interaction - Categorical variable indicating the type of interaction that took place
Conversion - indicating whether a conversion took place, 0: not converted, 1: converted
Conversion value - Value of the potential conversion event
Channel (target variable) - The marketing channel that brought the customer to our site

## Concepts Covered in this Attribution Modeling Python Project
This multi-touch attribution model data science project covers the following marketing and data science concepts -
### Exploratory Data Analysis
This project covers the implementation of Python data analysis libraries like NumPy, Pandas, etc. You will learn how to perform analysis at the granular level and understand how customer conversions are performed through different channels. The project will teach you how to handle categorical and numerical data simultaneously. You will use statistical tools like correlations to deeply understand the relationships among other variables. Additionally, you will learn how to prepare an HTML report to display the stats of each variable in the dataset. You can use this report as a template for other datasets. Lastly, this project will also assist you in dealing with duplicate values in a dataset.
### Single Touch Attribution Models
There are three single-touch attribution models that you will study in this project.
- Last-touch attribution model: It gives the utmost importance to the channel the customer interacted with the last with, just before conversion.
- The first touch attribution model considers the customer's first interaction with the channel, responsible for conversion.
- Last nondirect Touch Attribution model: This model considers the second-last channel the customer interacts with, before conversion, as the most crucial channel.
The project will guide how to implement these models in the Python programming language.
### Multi-Touch Attribution Model
With digital marketing campaigns in the picture, relying on single-touch models for attribution modeling becomes difficult. That is why analysts resort to multi-touch attribution analysis. Unlike single-touch models, the multi-touch model assumes all the channels that a customer interacts with, play a critical role in conversions. This project will cover the following three multi-touch attribution models:
- Linear Attribution Model: This model gives equal importance to all the customer-channel interactions.
- Position based (U-shaped) Attribution model: This model assumes that the first and the last customer-channel interactions play vital roles in conversions
- Position Decay Attribution model: This model gives the highest weightage to the latest customer-channel interaction, and the importance decays as it traverses previous interactions.
This project will guide you through implementing all three models by defining their functions in Python.
### Probabilistic Attribution Model
The probability attribution model relies on statistical and machine learning techniques for analyzing the contribution of all the customer-channel interactions. This project will teach you the following two models:
- The Markov Attribution model uses the Markov-chain algorithm to assign weights to all the channels that lead to conversions.
- Shapley Value model: This model uses Shapley value (cooperative game theory) to quantify the influence of each channel.
### Budget Optimization
Finally, the project will teach you to determine which model will work best for your specific problem. After that, you will learn how to optimize the marketing budget, that is, understand which channels should be allocated with what percentage of the budget to drive maximum conversions.
### FAQs on Multi-touch Attribution Models
The best multi-touch attribution model will be the one that works the best for your dataset. A multi-touch attribution model is a model which changes from business to business, lineage to lineage. It solely depends on which level of touch you are attributing a conversion. Some of the famous multitouch attribution models are:
- Linear Multi-Touch Marketing Attribution Model
- U-Shaped Multi-Touch Marketing Attribution Model
- Time Decay Multi-Touch Marketing Attribution Model
- W-Shaped Multi-Touch Marketing Attribution Model
- Choose the multi-touch attribution model that you believe will suit your dataset by analyzing which channels were prominent in serving as the point of conversion.
- If you conclude a probabilistic model works the best, then follow the steps for a Shapely model or any other Position Decay model.
- If you deduce that the first and last steps of the conversion process are the most important, then will follow the steps for a Position Based attribution model.
- Use a programming language like Python to define a function that takes your data as the input. The function must filter the conversions from the data, store the corresponding cookie IDs, aggregate the click counts and then distribute them according to the chosen model.
- Once the model has been designed, you can use it to analyze the influence of each channel.
