Computes the mean of elements across dimensions of a tensor.


```python
tf.math.reduce_mean(
    input_tensor, axis=None, keepdims=False, name=None
)
```

Reduces input_tensor along the dimensions given in axis by computing the
mean of elements across the dimensions in axis .
Unless keepdims is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each
of the entries in axis , which must be unique. If keepdims is true, the
reduced dimensions are retained with length 1.
If axis is None, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor with a single
element is returned.


```python
x = tf.constant([[1., 1.], [2., 2.]])
tf.reduce_mean(x)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=1.5>
tf.reduce_mean(x, 0)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([1.5, 1.5], dtype=float32)>
tf.reduce_mean(x, 1)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([1., 2.], dtype=float32)>
```




## Args
input_tensor The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type. axis The dimensions to reduce. If None (the default), reduces all
dimensions. Must be in the range [-rank(input_tensor),
rank(input_tensor)) . keepdims If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1. name A name for the operation (optional).


## Returns


## numpy compatibility
Please note that np.mean has a dtype parameter that could be used to
specify the output type. By default this is dtype=float64 . On the other
hand, tf.reduce_mean has an aggressive type inference from input_tensor ,
for example:


```python
x = tf.constant([1, 0, 1, 0])
tf.reduce_mean(x)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=0>
y = tf.constant([1., 0., 1., 0.])
tf.reduce_mean(y)
<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=0.5>
```
