# pairwise_kernels#
Compute the kernel between arrays X and optional array Y.
This function takes one or two feature arrays or a kernel matrix, and returns
a kernel matrix.
- If X is a feature array, of shape (n_samples_X, n_features), and: Y is None and metric is not ‘precomputed’, the pairwise kernels
between X and itself are returned. Y is a feature array of shape (n_samples_Y, n_features), the pairwise
kernels between X and Y is returned.
If X is a feature array, of shape (n_samples_X, n_features), and:
- Y is None and metric is not ‘precomputed’, the pairwise kernels
between X and itself are returned.
- Y is a feature array of shape (n_samples_Y, n_features), the pairwise
kernels between X and Y is returned.
- If X is a kernel matrix, of shape (n_samples_X, n_samples_X), metric should be ‘precomputed’. Y is thus ignored and X is returned as is.
This method provides a safe way to take a kernel matrix as input, while
preserving compatibility with many other algorithms that take a vector
array.

Array of pairwise kernels between samples, or a feature array.
The shape of the array should be (n_samples_X, n_samples_X) if
metric == “precomputed” and (n_samples_X, n_features) otherwise.
A second feature array only if X has shape (n_samples_X, n_features).
The metric to use when calculating kernel between instances in a
feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the metrics
in pairwise.PAIRWISE_KERNEL_FUNCTIONS .
If metric is “precomputed”, X is assumed to be a kernel matrix.
Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on each
pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
should take two rows from X as input and return the corresponding
kernel value as a single number. This means that callables from sklearn.metrics.pairwise are not allowed, as they operate on
matrices, not single samples. Use the string identifying the kernel
instead.
Whether to filter invalid parameters or not.
The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by breaking
down the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing them
using multithreading.
None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details.
Any further parameters are passed directly to the kernel function.
A kernel matrix K such that K_{i, j} is the kernel between the
ith and jth vectors of the given matrix X, if Y is None.
If Y is not None, then K_{i, j} is the kernel between the ith array
from X and the jth array from Y.
Notes
If metric is a callable, no restrictions are placed on X and Y dimensions.
Examples
```python
>>> from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_kernels
>>> X = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
>>> Y = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0]]
>>> pairwise_kernels(X, Y, metric='linear')
array([[0., 0.],
[1., 2.]])
```
