# filter() in python
filter() function is used to extract elements from an iterable (like a list, tuple or set) that satisfy a given condition. It works by applying a function to each element and keeping only those for which function returns True.
## Basic Example
This simple example shows how to keep only the words starting with the letter 'a' from a list of fruits.
```python
def starts_a(w):
return w.startswith("a")
li = ["apple", "banana", "avocado", "cherry", "apricot"]
res = filter(starts_a, li)
print(list(res))
```
```python
['apple', 'avocado', 'apricot']
```
Explanation: function starts_a checks if a word begins with ' a ' and filter() applies this function to each fruit and returns only matching ones.
### Syntax
filter(function, iterable)
Parameters:
- function: tests each element and if return, True - Keep the element, if False - Discard the element
- iterable: Any iterable (list, tuple, set, etc.).
Return Value: A filter object (an iterator), which can be converted into a list, tuple, set, etc.
## Examples of filter function
Let's explore some examples of filter() function and see how it is used.
### Example 1: Using filter() with a Named Function
This code defines a regular function to check if a number is even and then uses filter() to extract all even numbers from a list.
```python
def even(n):
return n % 2 == 0
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
b = filter(even, a)
print(list(b)) # Convert filter object to a list
```
```python
[2, 4, 6]
```
Explanation:
- even function checks if a number is divisible by 2.
- filter() applies this function to each item in a.
- Only even numbers are included in output.
### Example 2: Using filter() with a Lambda Function
Instead of creating a separate named function, use a lambda function for concise code. Below code uses a lambda function with filter() to select even numbers from a list.
```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
b = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, a)
print(list(b))
```
Explanation: filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, a) keeps only numbers divisible by 2 (even numbers).
### Example 3: Filtering and Transforming Data
In this Example lambda functions is used with filter() and map() to first get even numbers from a list and then double them.
```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
b = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, a)
c = map(lambda x: x * 2, b)
print(list(c))
```
```python
[4, 8, 12]
```
- filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, a): Selects only even numbers from the list ([2, 4, 6]).
- map(lambda x: x * 2, b): Doubles each of the filtered even numbers ([4, 8, 12]).
### Example 4: Filtering Strings
Here, lambda function is used with filter() to keep only words that have more than 5 letters from a list of fruits.
```python
a = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "grape"]
b = filter(lambda w: len(w) > 5, a)
print(list(b))
```
```python
['banana', 'cherry']
```
### Example 5: Filtering with None (Truthiness Check)
This code uses filter() with None as the function to remove all falsy values (like empty strings, None and 0) from a list.
```python
L = ["apple", "", None, "banana", 0, "cherry"]
A = filter(None, L)
print(list(A))
```
```python
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
Explanation: filter(None, L) removes all falsy values (empty string, None and 0) and keeps only truthy ones.
