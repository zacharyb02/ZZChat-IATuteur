# Loan Eligibility Prediction in Python using H2O.ai
In this loan prediction project you will build predictive models in Python using H2O.ai to predict if an applicant is able to repay the loan or not.
## Project Outcomes
- What is H2O and why is it used
- Initializing an H2O cluster for using all cores of CPU and RAM
- Importing the dataset from amazon AWS
- Performing basic EDA on the dataset
- Visualizing the dataset using Quantiles and Histograms
- Constructing test and train sets using sampling
- Defining the data for the model and displaying the results
- Applying GLM model for making predictions
- Defining mean_squared_error for evaluation metrics
- View model information: training statistics, performance, important variables
- Defining the parameters for a deep leaning Neural Networks
- The first part of the data, without labels for unsupervised learning
- The second part of the data, with labels for supervised learning
- Converting train dataset with autoencoder model to lower-dimensional space
- Training the DRF on reduced feature space
- Making the final predictions

## Source code + Project materials
## Project Description
Business Objective
When a customer applies for a loan at our company, we use statistical models to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid. The factors involved in determining this likelihood are complex, and extensive statistical analysis and modelling are required to predict the outcome for each individual case.
Aim
You must implement a model that predicts if a loan should be granted to an individual based on the data provided
Tech Stack
- Language : Python
- Libraries : Scikit-learn, H2O, pandas, numpy, flask, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Containerization : Docker
Dataset Description
The dataset used is an anonymized synthetic data that was generated specifically for use in this project. The data is designed to exhibit similar characteristics to genuine loan data.
In this dataset, you must explore and cleanse a dataset consisting of over 1,00,000 loan records to determine the best way to predict whether a loan applicant should be granted a loan or not.
