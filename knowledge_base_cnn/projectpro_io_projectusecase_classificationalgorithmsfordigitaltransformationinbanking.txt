# Build Classification Algorithms for Digital Transformation[Banking]
Implement a machine learning approach using various classification techniques in Python to examine the digitalisation process of bank customers.
## Project Outcomes
- Understanding the business problem.
- Importing the dataset and required libraries.
- Performing basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Removal of unwanted features and missing data handling if required, using appropriate methods.
- Checking data distribution using statistical techniques.
- Using python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn for data interpretation and advanced visualizations.
- Splitting Dataset into Train and Test using sklearn.
- Training a model using Classification techniques like Logistics Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, etc
- Tuning hyper-parameters of models to achieve optimal performance.
- Making predictions using the trained model.
- Gaining confidence in the model using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, recall, precision and f1 score
- Handling the unbalanced data using various methods.
- How Target variable is dependent on the values of Input features.
- Selection of the best model based on performance metrics.
- Saving the best model in pickle format for future use

## Project Description
Business Objective
Bank XYZ has a growing customer base where the majority of them are liability customers (depositors) vs. borrowers (asset customers). The bank is interested in expanding the borrower’s base rapidly to bring in more business via loan interests.
A campaign that the bank ran in the last quarter showed an average single-digit conversion rate. In the last town hall, the marketing head mentioned that digital transformation is the core strength of the business strategy, how to devise effective campaigns with better target marketing to increase the conversion ratio to double-digit with the same budget as per the last campaign.
As a data scientist, you are asked to develop a machine learning model to identify potential borrowers to support focused marketing.
Data Description
The dataset has 2 CSV files,
- Data1 - 5000 rows and 8 columns
- Data 2 - 5000 rows and 7 columns
Aim
Build a machine learning model to perform focused digital marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert from liability customers to asset customers.
