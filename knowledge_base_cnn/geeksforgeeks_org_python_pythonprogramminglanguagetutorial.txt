# Python Tutorial
Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It’s simple to use, packed with features and supported by a wide range of libraries and frameworks. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly.
- A high-level language, used in data science, automation, AI, web development and more.
- Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand and maintain.
- Backed by strong library support, we don’t have to build everything from scratch.
## Basic Code Example
The following is a simple program that displays the message “Hello, World!” on the screen.
```python
# Python Program to Print Hello World!
print("Hello World!")
```
```python
Hello World!
```
To understand working of this code, refer to our article Python Introduction .
## Why Learn Python?
- Requires fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages like Java.
- Provides Libraries / Frameworks like Django, Flask and many more for Web Development, and Pandas, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn and many more for, AI/ML, Data Science and Data Analysis
- Cross-platform, works on Windows, Mac and Linux without major changes.
- Used by top tech companies like Google, Netflix and NASA.
- Many Python coding job opportunities in Software Development, Data Science and AI/ML.

## Packages or Libraries
Python is a huge collection of Python Packages standard libraries that make development easier. These libraries help with a wide range of tasks and can save you a lot of time by providing ready-to-use tools.
Some commonly used types of libraries in Python include:
- Packages
- Built-in Modules
- DSA Libraries
- GUI Libraries
## Data Science
1. Foundational Libraries : These are the libraries that form the base for all data science work. Start here to build a strong foundation.
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
2. Advanced Visualization and Statistical Tools: Once you’re comfortable with basic data handling and visualization, move to creating cleaner visuals and performing statistical analysis.
- Seaborn
- Statsmodel
3. Machine Learning Libraries: After data manipulation and visualization, learn machine learning, starting with simpler models and moving to advanced ones.
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost / LightGBM
4. Deep Learning Frameworks: If you’re interested in AI and deep learning, these libraries will allow you to build and train neural networks.
- TensorFlow and Keras
- PyTorch
