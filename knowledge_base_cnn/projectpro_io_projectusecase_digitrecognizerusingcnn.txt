## Source code + Project materials
## Project Description
Business Overview
The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset popularly known as MNIST dataset is widely used as a standard dataset in deep learning. The dataset was released in 1999. The classic dataset serves as a basis for testing most of the classification algorithms. In the emerging field of machine learning the MNIST dataset remains one of the reliable resources to test the new techniques. The training dataset contains 60,000 and the testing dataset contains 10,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits between 0 to 9 each of 28x 28 pixels.
Aim: To correctly identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
