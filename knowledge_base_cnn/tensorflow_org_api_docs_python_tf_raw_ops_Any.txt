```python
tf.raw_ops.Any(
    input, axis, keep_dims=False, name=None
)
```


Reduces input along the dimensions given in axis . Unless keep_dims is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in axis . If keep_dims is true, the reduced dimensions are
retained with length 1.


## Args
input A Tensor of type bool . The tensor to reduce. axis A Tensor . Must be one of the following types: int32 , int64 .
The dimensions to reduce. Must be in the range [-rank(input), rank(input)) . keep_dims An optional bool . Defaults to False .
If true, retain reduced dimensions with length 1. name A name for the operation (optional).
Returns A Tensor of type bool .
