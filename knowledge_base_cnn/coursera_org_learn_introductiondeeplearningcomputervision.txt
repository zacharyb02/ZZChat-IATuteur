## There are 4 modules in this course
Starting with zero deep learning knowledge, this foundational course will guide you to effectively train cutting-edge models for image classification purposes. From analyzing medical images to recognizing traffic signs, classification is important for many applications. Classification models also serve as the backbone for more complicated object detection models. Through hands-on projects, you will train and evaluate models to classify street signs and identify the letters of American Sign Language. By completing this course, you will develop a strong foundation in deep learning for image analysis and will be equipped with the skills to tackle real-world computer vision challenges.
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
•	Explain how deep learning networks find image features and make predictions
•	Retrain common models like GoogLeNet and ResNet for specific applications
•	Investigate model behavior to identify errors and determine potential fixes
•	Improve model performance by tuning hyperparameters
•	Complete the entire deep learning workflow in a final project
For the duration of the course, you will have free access to MATLAB, software used by top employers worldwide. The courses draw on the applications using MATLAB, so you spend less time coding and more time applying deep learning concepts.

## Frequently asked questions
Yes. A free license is available to learners enrolled in the course. You must have a computer capable of running MATLAB. You can view the system requirements here .
To access the course materials, assignments and to earn a Certificate, you will need to purchase the Certificate experience when you enroll in a course.  You can try a Free Trial instead, or apply for Financial Aid. The course may offer 'Full Course, No Certificate' instead. This option lets you see all course materials, submit required assessments, and get a final grade. This also means that you will not be able to purchase a Certificate experience.
When you enroll in the course, you get access to all of the courses in the Certificate, and you earn a certificate when you complete the work. Your electronic Certificate will be added to your Accomplishments page - from there, you can print your Certificate or add it to your LinkedIn profile.
