## Project Description
Business Objective
Antibiograms are often used by clinicians to assess local susceptibility rates to select empiric antibiotic therapy, and monitor resistance trends over time. The testing occurs in a medical laboratory and uses culture methods that expose bacteria to antibiotics to test if bacteria have genes that confer resistance. Culture methods often involve measuring the diameter of areas without bacterial growth, called zones of inhibition. The zone of inhibition is a circular area around the antibiotic spot in which the bacteria colonies do not grow. The zone of inhibition can be used to measure the susceptibility of the bacteria to the antibiotic. The process of locating the zones and related inhibitions can be automated using image detection and segmentation.
Image Classification helps us classify what is contained in an image, whereas object Detection specifies the location of multiple objects in the image. On the other hand, image Segmentation will create a pixel-wise mask of each object in the images, which helps identify the shapes of different objects in the image.
We have dealt with image classification in the project, Build a Multi Class Image Classification Model Python using CNN . This project will perform image detection and segmentation on a given set of images to detect the zones and inhibition of the bacteria present in a collection of images using the Detectron2 model.
Data Description
The dataset contains several antibiogram test images divided into training and testing folders. There are around 50 images in the training dataset and five in the testing.
Aim
To build a Dectectron2 model that can detect zones and inhibitions in a given image.
Tech stack
- Language - Python
