# Image Segmentation using Mask R-CNN with Tensorflow
In this Deep Learning Project on Image Segmentation Python, you will learn how to implement the Mask R-CNN model for early fire detection.
## Project Outcomes
- Understanding the business problem.
- Understanding the concepts of image detection, image localisation and image segmentation.
- Understanding the concepts behind Region Proposal Network (RPN), ROI Classifier and bounding box Regressor.
- Understanding the concept behind transfer learning and how is it different from machine learning.
- Understanding the concept of Backbone and role of backbone (restnet101) in Mask RCNN model.
- Understanding of MS COCO and how to load the pretrained COCO as weights.
- Performing image annotation using VGG Annotator.
- Importing the image data and required libraries.
- Defining and understanding a class for configuration for training on the dataset.
- Learning how to add and use annotated images.
- Fitting Mask RCNN modelling over train and validation images along with annotation files.
- Understanding how to create and store the log files per epoch.
- Defining of Inference configuration and model
- Making predictions over the test data (Inference)

## Source code + Project materials
## Project Description
Business Objective
Fire is one of the deadliest risks any person can encounter in his life. In a concise time frame, fire can wreck an area, say in a forest, hut, house, building, etc. Fire can lead to the loss of expensive property, and in the worst possible scenario, it can also lead to the loss of human life. Detecting fire thus becomes a significant concern.
Our project will carry out fire detection by adopting an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) model based on chromatic and disorder measurement for extracting fire pixels and smoke pixels. Our main aim is to locate the position where the fire is present, which will help the authorities take proper measures to avoid any loss. To prevent this, we will build an early fire detection using image segmentation with the help of the mrcnn model.
Image Localization helps to detect the location of a single object in any given image. In our case, image localization can locate the fire in a given image.
We will be using image segmentation, in which we group a similar set of pixels, i.e., divide the image into segments and thus make use of the essential segments. Hence image segmentation is used in this project as it gives us the desired location of our object in the image.
Further, we will use the Mask RCNN model to train and build predictions over our input images. Mask RCNN is a deep neural network algorithm that is used for solving segmentation problems.
This project aims to build a deep neural network model that will give the best accuracy in detecting fire in an image.
Note
Since the original Mask R-CNN implementation has not been updated for newer TensorFlow versions and is incompatible with Python 3.12, an updated PyTorch version has been added to the code folder.
Data Description
- In this case, we use 20 fire images for the training set and ten fire images for the validation set, and one image for test data. These images can be JPG, PNG, TIF formats.
- Via_project.json is the annotation file containing the region of interest marked.
Aim
This project aims to make predictions over images and detect mask and bounding boxes around the area of interest, i.e., mask and bounding around the fire in a given image.
Tech stack
- Language - Python
- Libraries – n umpy, keras, tensorflow, mrcnn, scikit-image, etc (as mentioned in the requirements.txt file)
Approach
- Install the requirements.txt file.
- Import the required libraries.
- Using the VGG Annotator, create annotations and save them in the JSON files. Then creating a class to add these annotations and use them. (Link for the VGG Annotator - https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via_demo.html )
- Define LoadDatatset class for loading of image data and annotations for train and inference data.
- The setting of the root directory for the project and the path of the weights file.
- Define config class for setting configuration for training on the dataset.
- Define the LoadBackBone for train and inference data class, for loading the backbone pre-trained weights to extract features.
- Model Building (Using Mask RCNN)
- On training data images
- On validation data images.
- Predict the mask and then plot it over the test data images.
